								<p>Leaders within law firms and legal departments have identified that business and
									legal process improvements are mandatory to stay competitive in an ever-changing
									market. This topic is a great fit for ILTA’s Law2020 initiative that focuses on ways
									in which legal organizations must adapt to thrive in the future. We enlisted three
									of your ILTA peers to share their thoughts on improvements to make today for a
									better tomorrow, and they shared visions of the future. Each participant was
									interviewed separately, and we highly recommend you listen to the associated <a
										href="http://www.iltanet.org/MainMenuCategory/Recordings/Podcasts/Improving-Today-for-a-Better-Tomorrow.html"
										target="_blank">podcasts</a> to hear all that our participants had to say. Here
									is a preview:</p>
								<p><strong>What are the benefits of making improvements to business and legal
										processes?</strong></p>
								<p><strong>Angela Dowd:</strong> Reduction of waste is one of the first benefits that
									comes to mind. Since the Great Recession, we continuously hear that firms and law
									departments are being challenged to do more with less, both internally and from
									clients. Process improvements are a way to not only cut costs but also to eliminate
									tedious tasks. Process improvements can reduce errors and improve the quality and
									consistency of the work produced. Business and legal process improvements ultimately
									are about delivering value to the client.</p>
								<p><strong>Ted Theodoropolous:</strong> The management consultant Edwards Deming once
									said that if you can’t describe what you’re doing as a process, you don’t know what
									you’re doing. I believe that to be true, and it’s widely accepted in most
									industries. Firms would benefit from adopting that mantra and incorporating it into
									the DNA of their business. They can differentiate their firm from others by
									demonstrating to clients a commitment to efficiency.</p>
								<p><strong>Toby Brown:</strong> On the business side, there’s definitely room for
									improvement in the way firms are run, separately from how we deliver our services.
									Those benefits are somewhat obvious in terms of efficiencies. I see more important
									benefits in being responsive to the lawyers and partners in the firm. On the legal
									side, the canary in the coal mine for me is write-offs and write-downs, depending on
									how you define those. If we look to process improvements in the way we deliver our
									services, we can reduce our exposure to work for which we don’t get paid. I would
									call that the short-run benefit. The long-run benefit will be happier clients
									because we’ll be more competitive in our pricing and cost of services.</p>
								<p><strong>How do you determine whether your process can be better improved with a
										people change or a technology change? </strong></p>
								<p><strong>Ted:</strong> I don’t see these as being mutually exclusive — there usually
									is significant people and technology change required when improving a process. Step
									one in a firmwide effort to adopt business process improvements (BPIs) is getting
									buy-in at the executive level. Step two is getting leaders to show commitment to
									BPI, and that can take the form of getting certified, having explicit communications
									with the rest of the firm regarding the initiative, structuring incentives around
									compliance or even publicly recognizing excellence in the realm when it happens. All
									of those things are people-centric. Once the people at the firm have been aligned in
									this way, then you can bring in the technology.</p>
								<p><strong>Toby:</strong> I start on the people side of things. I’m very focused on
									profitability, so first I see how things are being staffed. Are we using the right
									level of expertise to perform different tasks? If not, go back and ask why the
									process is driving work to that level of timekeeper. Beyond that, pressures related
									to pricing and rates can dictate where we use technology. For example, we’re looking
									to use technology to speed up a process that could no longer be affected by staffing
									changes.</p>
								<p><strong>Angela:</strong> That’s going to depend on the process and the firm or law
									department. Every organization has a different appetite for change and for fiscal
									investment in process improvements. There is a tendency for people to think that
									technology will be some magical panacea for process problems, but technology alone
									can’t fix an issue. As Ted mentioned, technology and people must go hand-in-hand.
									And when I think about a technology change, I don’t necessarily mean a new
									technology. Often we reuse or better leverage existing technology to help solve a
									problem.</p>
								<p><strong>What process improvements should firms and legal departments implement
										now?</strong></p>
								<p><strong>Toby:</strong> Legal departments and law firms should look at processes
									related to how they develop budgets for matters and engagements because that
									typically is done haphazardly. Both firms and legal departments would benefit
									significantly from having a well-defined, thoughtful process for determining the
									budget for an engagement. That process improvement would provide high value, and it
									has immediacy because everyone is concerned about fees and budgets.</p>
								<p><strong>Angela:</strong> It’s going to depend on the type of practice your firm does
									and the culture of your firm or law department. New matter intake and conflicts are
									at the top of most people’s lists. These often have multiple administrative groups
									backing the project, and there are mature technologies already set up to help with
									this. However, some organizations aren’t ready for that big a step, so take a look
									at smaller processes. Look for a stakeholder who has a problem with a current
									process. By starting with that bite-sized chunk, you will have an audience that has
									an interest in working with you to make a process improvement. A win with one
									stakeholder can lead to their help with buy-in from a larger audience.</p>
								<p><strong>Ted:</strong> Pick that low-hanging fruit first. Those are usually highly
									repetitive processes that are easily identified and relatively well-understood.
									Processes done hundreds of times a day are good candidates for dividing up
									responsibilities across different labor tiers and can provide immediate and
									measurable cost savings.</p>
								<p><strong>What&#8217;s the one piece of advice you&#8217;d give to someone embarking on
										a long-term process improvement initiative? </strong></p>
								<p><strong>Toby:</strong> You always hear “start simple,” but my advice is to follow the
									money. If you’re looking to where you want to have impact or where you need to have
									impact — I mentioned write-downs and write-offs earlier — that’s the place to start.
									Look at the work you’re doing that you’re not getting paid for, whether it’s a fixed
									fee, an hourly billing or other fee structure. You want to have an immediate impact
									on the bottom line.</p>
								<p><strong>Angela:</strong> My one piece of advice is to be patient. We work in legal,
									and we are not the fastest to adopt new things. Don’t give up. It’s a continuous
									process. You might want to jump in and start a big project to kick things off, but
									sometimes it’s about starting small and building that momentum organically. If
									something doesn’t work, look at it from a different angle. There’s this idea in the
									corporate world about learning from failure. We don’t necessarily have that in our
									DNA in law firms and law departments, but process improvement is not a
									set-it-andforget-it fix. You need to continuously go back, get feedback, refine your
									processes, improve your change management or marketing tactics, etc. Patience
									throughout it all will work in your favor.</p>
								<p><strong>Ted:</strong> The key words here are “long-term.” In any long-term endeavor,
									it’s always good to have a solid starting point. Get some quick wins on the board,
									and leverage an existing disciple like Lean Six Sigma. The benefit of Lean Six Sigma
									is you will always do a baseline, so you’ll measure how a process performs before
									and after you’ve re-engineered it. That will give you the ammunition you need to
									generate senior-level buy-in, which will help you move your BPI initiative across
									the rest of the business. The most important thing is to demonstrate that it works.
									Once you do that, it becomes much easier to knock down walls into different silos of
									the business.</p>
								<p><strong>Imagine the &#8220;modern law firm&#8221; in the year 2040. Tell me what that
										looks like. </strong></p>
								<p><strong>Ted:</strong> 2040 — that’s a long time from now! It’s hard to talk about the
									future of law without incorporating some of Richard Susskind’s ideas into the
									conversation. I recently read Susskind’s Tomorrow’s Lawyers, and he talks about
									three main drivers of change.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The “more-for-less” challenge, which is where rising regulatory pressures on
										businesses and declining legal budgets create a market scenario where firms that
										embrace efficiency get rewarded</li>
								</ul>
								<ul>
									<li>Liberalization, which is a relaxation of the laws and regulations that govern
										who can perform legal work, which means certain categories of legal services
										will be done by non-lawyers in the future</li>
								</ul>
								<ul>
									<li>Information technology (any attorney who doubts that IT will have a major impact
										in legal should watch the Jeopardy series where Watson beats the brightest minds
										the show ever had)</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Alternate business structures are already being accepted, and they will not have the
									limiting mindset a lot of law firms have where they think this is a profession and
									not a business. This brings the medical profession to mind. We’re seeing “minute
									clinics” and 24-hour urgent care facilities pop up everywhere, and medical care is
									even being delivered via Skype. There has been a tremendous amount of change there.
									Legal isn’t far behind.</p>
								<p><strong>Toby:</strong> Law firms will need to act like a business by then. Client
									satisfaction must be at the forefront as we move into that phase of the market’s
									evolution. Continuous improvement and product innovations are important aspects of
									maintaining client satisfaction. In terms of innovation, think of proactive, risk
									reduction offerings that law firms rarely serve up to their clients.</p>
								<p><strong>Angela:</strong> In 2040, stakeholders and rainmakers will have different
									cultural backgrounds, and law firms will be much more agile and responsive to client
									needs. Matters will be much more collaborative and better managed. Many tasks
									attorneys do today will be automated or even self-service from the client
									perspective. There will be greater transparency, forcing firms to continuously
									refine their processes. I also see less stratification of attorneys, less emphasis
									on the big corner office, which will go hand-in-hand with increased collaboration,
									both internally and externally. That will tie to there being a larger respect and
									reliance on the skills of the professional staff to manage the business of law.</p>
