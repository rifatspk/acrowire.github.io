								<p>Carolyn Seaman, Associate Professor of Information Systems at UMBC in Baltimore,
									interviews Ted Theodoropoulos, Acrowire President, on how Technical Debt can be
									taken on safely and managed successfully – ultimately bridging the gap between
									technology and business by allowing organizations to prioritize debt remediation
									efforts based on ROI.<span id="more-1449"></span></p>
								<h3>1. Defining Technical Debt in Today’s Industry</strong></h3>
								<p><strong>Carolyn: We all know what Technical Debt is – the term that Ward Cunningham
										coined back in 1992. Since then the metaphor has become quite popular, even
										among researchers. But the definition has evolved, and we have noticed a lot of
										disagreements about what Technical Debt really is, particularly about what it
										does or doesn’t include. Ted, what is your opinion on how the term has been
										picked up by the industry?</strong><br />
									Ted: My opinion is consistent with how you categorize the evolution of Technical
									Debt. The term has become quite fragmented and I think there is a fair amount of
									disagreement as to what’s included and what isn’t, even among the major thought
									leaders in the industry:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Bob Martin and his assessment of “cruft”, which is slang term for sloppy code,
										which he does not feel rises to the level of Technical Debt.</li>
									<li>Ward Cunningham’s definition, which does not include cruft, and does not include
										deferred functionality.</li>
									<li>Gartner’s definition of IT debt, which is closely linked to Technical Debt and
										includes infrastructure related items</li>
									<li>Chris Sterling’s book on Software Debt creates somewhat of a hierarchy, where
										Software Debt becomes a superset of Technical Debt. Of course, Ward refers to it
										as Technical Debt.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>So, there is a lot of fragmentation which has led to some obscure classifications and
									terminology. There are things out there in the blogging sphere, such as peering
									debt, platform experience debt, configuration management debt… I’m not sure what
									that is! But overall I feel that there has been a disproportionate focus on items
									related to intrinsic quality. This has been supported by a lot of folks, such as Jim
									Highsmith, who solely focus on building the system right. In my opinion this
									neglects the interdependent nature of software quality.<br />
									I am of the opinion that software quality needs to be managed holistically. And
									there needs to be an equal focus on building the right system and building the
									system right. And I just don’t think we are there in terms of defining Technical
									Debt today.</p>
								<p><strong>Carolyn: What is your working definition of technical debt?</strong><br />
									Ted: I tend to take a broad view. For me, Technical Debt is any gap within the
									technology infrastructure that has a material impact on the required level of
									quality, which includes infrastructure items. To define software quality, I would
									use an industry accepted standard such as the ISO 9001. I think this definition is
									more consistent with a stakeholder perspective. As a stakeholder, I want to know
									what in my technical environment I am paying interest on… I think if we define the
									term that is consistent with a stakeholder perspective, we have a much better chance
									of the metaphor gaining traction more broadly. But until we look at the issue from
									this management point, we are going to continue to have these conversations among
									software development professionals. I think we need a broader definition and that is
									why I am an advocate for this type of definition.</p>
								<p><strong>Carolyn: In last month’s interview, Steve McConnell came to the conclusion
										that we have not yet reached a perfect taxonomy or classification of Technical
										Debt. What do you think – is it useful to categorize Technical Debt? Do you
										carry around a categorization in your head?</strong><br />
									Ted: I would go much further than Steve McConnell in his assessment. I have not seen
									a credible taxonomy at all – Steve McConnell has proposed one, which is a great
									start, but we need to first reach an agreement on what Technical Debt is. Martin
									Fowler has done some work creating a matrix that gives perspective on different
									types of Technical Debt. The value proposition here is huge and I do think it’s
									nearly impossible to define technical debt in such broad terms like I am proposing
									without taxonomy. But until some sort of consensus on a conceptual model is agreed
									upon amongst the thought leaders, Technical Debt taxonomy would be a bit
									pre-mature.<br />
									At the ICSE conference last year, in 2011, I proposed forming a steering committee
									at the folks of the SEI. Everyone at the conference liked the idea but it never got
									off the ground. Once we get the consensus on the definition and framework, we can
									then go around defining some sort of taxonomy. Until that happens, I am not sure
									that that is where we need to focus.</p>
								<h3>2. Strategically Taking On Technical Debt</h3>
								<p><strong>Carolyn: Let’s turn our attention to what Technical Debt looks like on the
										ground and how it manifests itself in real projects. A lot of the time we see
										software professionals trying to avoid technical debt at all costs. Do you think
										that organizations should look towards eliminating all Technical Debt in any
										particular product, or can Technical Debt ultimately be something
										healthy?</strong><br />
									Ted: There is a clear answer to that question: Technical Debt is unavoidable and
									management should be the goal, not elimination. Like financial debt, Technical Debt
									is a form of financing and it should be leveraged. If an organization has a
									disproportionately low amount of Technical Debt relative to industry peers, they are
									probably being too conservative. On the flipside, disproportionately high amounts of
									Technical Debt compared to industry peers could indicate possibly too much risk. But
									if you think about technical resources as free cash flow (people, infrastructure,
									funding), then you can manage the right balance between technical debt and technical
									equity, almost like a financial balance sheet. Companies that have highly volatile
									free cash flows with the availability of technical resources going up and down based
									on cyclical factors, then I think that a company must assume lower debt and finance
									with technical equity. On the other hand if companies are experiencing and releasing
									minimum viable products, then it is a must that they finance those initiatives with
									technical debt. So I think that technical debt is healthy and management should be
									the goal, not elimination.</p>
								<p><strong>Carolyn: What type of questions should decision makers be asking themselves
										when they are trying to decide if it is appropriate to take on technical
										debt?</strong><br />
									Ted: That is a great question and the right kind of question to be asking, because
									taking on Technical Debt is a business decision, not a technical one.<br />
									In instances where time to market is critical and there is some uncertainty with
									respect to demand, then financing initiatives with technical debt should be
									considered. There is a big movement in Silicon Valley with lead-start methodologies
									which require heavy debt financing: the least that you can do to get the product out
									the door to get validated learning and real feedback from real customers. This
									necessitates the use of financing your products with technical debt. And there is a
									very sound reason behind pushing forward with minimum viable products and assuming
									debt, because the interest probability is very low. </p>
								<p>Technical Debt has 3 main components: the principal, the interest, and interest
									probability. The interest probability is the likelihood that the interest is going
									to be needed to be paid-back. If you are in experimental mode, you probably have a
									relative low interest probability, so the prospect of financing with debt becomes
									more attractive. I think that to finance with technical debt and to do it safely,
									you need to manage and track it centrally. My exposure with technical debt comes
									from both as an entrepreneur, a technical person, and in the corporate world. When I
									was in risk management &#038; corporate audit for one of the biggest banks in the
									world, we actually had a central system (a registration database) which wasn’t
									called Technical Debt (although that’s essentially what it was…) which stored
									technical risk related items, and impediments to productivity. That central
									registration database was a key management tool.</p>
								<p>So I think that in order to use technical debt safely, we need to understand the
									implications of if the risks materialize, what the potential outcomes are, and what
									usage patterns could potentially be problematic given the technical debt present in
									an application or in a piece of infrastructure. Having a well thought out mitigation
									plan is essential: if you understand what the implications are and you are
									monitoring for conditions for which those implications could arise, then I think
									that’s the best case scenario and Technical Debt here becomes a much more controlled
									and safe option in your portfolio.</p>
								<h3>3. Visualizing Technical Debt</h3>
								<p><strong>Carolyn: Let’s dig into the management of Technical Debt a little bit more.
										One of the challenges organizations often face when it comes to Technical Debt
										is visualizing it. In your experience, have you seen any ways that people have
										been able to visualize either where the Technical Debt is in their system, or
										how much there is, and what types of debt there are?</strong><br />
									Ted: I was on the program committee for this year’s ISCE conference for Technical
									Debt and reviewed several papers that proposed interesting methodologies. I know
									that there are some great tools out there that allow you to get some visualization
									capabilities.</p>
								<p>The short answer to this question is: there are automated tools that exist in order
									for you to visualize your Technical Debt, but they are very new and I think these
									tools do need to mature in the coming years. That being said, they are a great
									starting point and should definitely be leveraged. Leveraging automated tools is
									critical in technical debt management because it is such a pervasive and widespread
									problem that in a big organization it is far too big to manage manually. So having
									good application lifecycle management processes that are automated (such as good
									test coverage, leveraging continuous integration, implementing continuous
									surveillance for risk factors, establishing KPIs) is essential. In my risk
									management days, we had a concept called Key Risk Indicators, which are composite
									metrics which can be monitored continuously through automated mechanisms. There are
									some great tools out there that can scan a source code repository and find
									indicators of poor code quality, inadequate code coverage, severe level agreement
									failures, poor data quality, etc. But in terms of getting a true visualization of
									Technical Debt in your system, this is something that is still relatively new and is
									still evolving in my opinion.</p>
								<h3>4. Measuring Technical Debt</h3>
								<p><strong>Carolyn: What about measurement? Is it useful to quantify Technical
										Debt?</strong><br />
									Ted: There are tools that will give you the dollar and cents amount of Technical
									Debt in your code base. Again, I take a broader view on what technical debt is and
									for me, Technical Debt is not only about the code base but also the supporting
									infrastructure of an application as well as its feature set. But there are certainly
									tools out there that can quantify Technical Debt.<br />
									Measuring principal is a fairly straight forward process. I put together a blog post
									at blog.acrowire.com that is dedicated to the measurement of technical debt. Gary
									Short also put together a simple formulate approach for calculating the principal.
									Calculating Technical Debt principal is fairly quantitative. But calculating
									interest is a bit more subjective, as it is a combination of calculating
									productivity cost and increased risk exposure. In addition, you also need to
									understand the rate at which interest compounds, i.e. workarounds which are created
									on top of workarounds. Interest is a more qualitative exercise but there are tools
									that allow you to get an estimate which is a good starting point. But nothing more
									than that – just a starting point.</p>
								<p><strong>Carolyn: Have you seen any organizations, yours or others, that explicitly
										quantify Technical Debt in some way or another, and use those estimates in their
										planning process?</strong><br />
									Ted: When I was working with a large financial institution, they would aggregate
									regulatory, internal and 3rd party audit exams. These were for technical systems and
									would aggregate the results in order to understand if the was audit satisfactory,
									unsatisfactory, needs improvement, etc. And we would calculate a score called an
									audit index. The number that was being calculated was not in dollars or cents, it
									was an index, but it essentially let us know if we were trending in the right
									direction or not.<br />
									So to answer your question: no I haven’t seen a technical debt balance sheet. But I
									think folks are experimenting with that I’ve heard. But I just have not seen it in
									action.</p>
								<p><strong>Carolyn: In your opinion, this is something that could be useful – to go to
										the point of tracking Technical Debt separately in a balance
										sheet?</strong><br />
									Ted: I see value in it but there are challenges. The metaphor has been around for 20
									years and things started to really heat up in the summer of 2010 when Gartner said
									that there was 500 billion dollars of Technical Debt globally and it was going to
									grow to 1.5 trillion by 2015. Calculating technical debt in not an exact science; it
									all depends on how you calculate it.<br />
									When I was talking about calculating interest of Technical Debt, I was explaining
									how it is a qualitative analysis: what does it cost to implement a feature today and
									what would it cost to implement that same feature if that system was designed
									appropriately? This is completely subjective. So that is the only thing that
									concerns me about getting too granular about the dollars and cents of Technical
									Debt. I think that if people use it as a guide it can be of significant value. I
									think it’s a mixed bag.</p>
								<h3>5. Communicating Technical Debt</h3>
								<p><strong>Carolyn: Technical Debt resides at an interesting interface between technical
										and non-technical. But what that also means is that in order to manage Technical
										Debt you have to communicate it well between non-technical folks and technical
										folks. Do you have any best practices in communicating the importance of
										Technical Debt between these two groups of people?</strong><br />
									Ted: That is the beauty of Technical Debt: it bridges the gap between business and
									technical stakeholders. We talked about a balance sheet approach – I mentioned some
									scenarios that I have seen in practice – and I think that on a case by case basis,
									the metaphor gives us the visibility to help prioritize with business stakeholders
									and it helps prioritize Technical Debt remediation efforts.<br />
									Business people always want to build new stuff. If a system is working but is
									difficult for the technical team to maintain, it is not become a priority for the
									business people. But when you come to the table with a prioritized list of
									initiatives and there is a return of investment associated with each one of them,
									then we have a different story. </p>
								<p>Technical Debt gives you the ability to essentially calculate an ROI for a Technical
									Debt remediation effort. Items such as refactoring codebase, implementing missing
									features, re plat-forming, upgrading technology, etc. will be off the radar of the
									business people. But, if you attach an ROI, it gets business people’s attention. It
									also helps understand the value of repayment and not just accumulate Technical Debt
									and forget about it. But once they’ve had to wait for the new flashy CRM feature
									because a Technical Debt refactoring initiative leap frogged it, then the
									conversation becomes more productive on how to prioritize the back log. As I said,
									business users always want new stuff and that is never going to change. As a
									business user you always ask: how can I get my job done more efficiently? Coming
									towards someone that is being sized on that criterion, you have to attach an ROI to
									the initiative, which technical debt allows you to do, and the conversation becomes
									a lot more productive. It has tremendous value.</p>
								<h3>6. Technical Debt vs. Agile</h3>
								<p><strong>Carolyn: Is there an inherent conflict in a team spending time tracking
										Technical Debt and paying it back, and also staying agile? Do those two things
										need to be balanced?</strong><br />
									Ted: Actually I not know how you stay Agile without solid technical debt management
									practices. By definition, agile is about being responsive to the market and to the
									business… and Technical Debt gets in the way of that. So, Technical Debt and agility
									are conflicting forces. I am not sure how an organization would stay agile if they
									did not have good technical debt management practices. They can be incorporated into
									the agile process themselves and existing agile processes already support good
									technical debt practice (continual integration, documentation, engagement with the
									product owner, early feedback, and good code coverage). Using agile practices
									properly automatically mitigates technical debt. Where technical debt can actually
									add value to the agile process is where those Technical Debt items are tracked and
									measured and an ROI is calculated. Here the ScrumMaster forces the conversation
									towards: “we need a refactoring sprint and to put it in the product backlog”.
									Technical Debt and staying agile: you can’t have one and the other! Agile practices
									complement a solid Technical Debt management strategy.</p>
