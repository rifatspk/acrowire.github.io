								<p>In this<strong> final installment</strong> on the Stakeholder Perspective on
									Technical Debt, we talk through how organizations will benefit from having
									technology teams engaged in managing issues affecting intrinsic and extrinsic
									quality.  An expanded definitional framework of technical debt will be proposed
									along with detail describing why this expanded definition bridges many gaps that
									exist today.</p>
								<h3><strong>Quality Collaboration</strong></h3>
								<p>When prioritizing a product backlog, product owners need to understand the quality
									implications associated with their decisions. To avoid the accumulation of
									unintentional technical debt, technology teams must work with product owners to
									evaluate the impact to overall quality associated with prioritization strategies.
									When stepping through the backlog there are three high level alternatives for each
									feature that must be evaluated.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>A. Do it right – no debt</p>
									<p>B. Do it quick – take shortcuts and accrue debt</p>
									<p>C. Do it later – defer functionality and accrue debt</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>Because Option C has been considered to primarily impact extrinsic quality it falls
									outside of the current scope of technical debt. This is a gap because we have seen
									from the examples in the <a
										href="../the-stakeholder-perspective-the-ecosystem.html">previous
										article</a> that impacts in one area of quality often have effects elsewhere. In
									the case of Option C, features are postponed and the desired solution is essentially
									being “borrowed” upon. The main difference between Options B and C is which part of
									the organization explicitly borrows and subsequently pays interest. If the
									development team borrows by taking shortcuts, they pay the bulk of the interest.
									When features are deferred, end users make most of the interest payments. Either way
									the organization must service the accrued debt.</p>
								<p>In Agile environments, product owners work very closely with technology teams. This
									is driven by the fourth principle of the Agile Manifesto which says that “Business
									people and developers must work together daily throughout the project” [4]. When we
									have development teams focus exclusively on intrinsic quality we leave it to product
									owners to manage extrinsic quality. It is critical that technology teams form a
									united front with product owners measuring and managing technical debt. Active
									participation from technology teams is critical because they will have insights
									product owners may not. Designers understand the relationship between user
									experience and adoption, database developers know what to expect if proper
									validation controls are not present and systems administrators are aware of the
									risks associated with legacy platforms. This expertise must be leveraged to ensure
									product owners do not have a blind spot in their perspective on technical debt.</p>
								<h3><strong>Proposed Definition</strong></h3>
								<p>In order to align technical debt’s definitional framework to stakeholder objectives,
									it should transition from what David Garvin describes as a manufacturing view to a
									value-based view of quality [2]. The value-based view equates quality to what the
									customer is willing to pay for and encourages everyone to consider trade-offs
									between cost and quality [5]. Managing these trade-offs is exactly what technical
									debt is meant to do. To capture this value-based perspective, the definitional
									framework should be revised to capture all technical gaps that present risk to
									required levels of quality. Our proposed definition of technical debt reads as
									follows.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p><em>“Technical debt is any gap within the technology infrastructure or its
											implementation which has a material impact on the required level of
											quality.”</em></p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>The “required level” of quality will vary from one environment to the next based on
									system requirements. An application that has no sensitive data might not require
									certain controls. The fact that such an application has no access controls would not
									be considered technical debt as we have defined it. However, if the application has
									access controls that are not needed but they cost money to maintain, it would
									qualify as debt. This might occur if the controls decrease productivity or staff is
									needed to manage password resets, etc. Technical debt represents the cost associated
									with gaps between an application and its quality requirements.</p>
								<p>Technical debt is shown in Figure 6 as the shaded portion of the graph where the
									application and its requirements do not overlap. This graph shows an application
									that has more Functionality and less Maintainability than is required. The cost
									associated with the unnecessary Functionality is technical debt and is represented
									by the blue shaded area of the graph. Conversely, the yellow shaded area of Figure 6
									represents technical debt that exists because of required levels of Maintainability
									that are not provided by this solution. The green area of the graph shows where
									quality requirements are supported which is analogous to technical equity.</p>
								<p><a href="../../assets/images/Figure-6.png"><img
											loading="lazy" title="Figure-6" alt="Figure-6"
											src="../../assets/images/Figure-6_thumb.png"
											width="438" height="478" border="0" /></a></p>
								<p><strong>Figure 6: Radar chart of technical debt</strong></p>
								<p>The proposed definition is focused on gaps in quality alignment that are costing the
									organization money. The cost associated with these gaps is technical debt where the
									principal amount is the capital required to close the gap and the interest is the
									associated recurring cost.</p>
								<h4><strong>Definition Scope</strong></h4>
								<p>To make technical debt a manageable concept it must have boundaries. The term
									“technical” debt implies that the issue driving the cost relates to something in the
									technology infrastructure. If the principal amount of the debt relates to an
									investment needed in the technical environment it should be considered a technical
									debt. The interest may be incurred outside of the technical environment but
									principal must be technology related. An example to consider is what sometimes is
									referred to as platform experience debt [6]. This type of debt describes the
									increased cost incurred to recruit and retain employees who have experience with a
									legacy or niche platform. While the interest on this debt pays for things outside
									technology (i.e. human resources), the principal amount owed is clearly in the
									technical environment.</p>
								<p>It follows that if the investment needed to pay back the principal would be made
									outside the technical environment it should not be considered technical debt.
									Therefore, gaps in supporting processes would not be considered technical debt. Only
									the technology required to support required processes should be considered debt. For
									example, the absence of a business continuity plan would not qualify as debt but the
									technology necessary to support such a plan would once defined. Without a defined
									process, requirements would not exist and calculating the principal of the debt is
									not possible. While processes gaps are not themselves debt, they can and often do
									lead to technical debt. Inadequate application lifecycle management processes is a
									case in point. Failure to employ proper quality assurance methods or development
									standards will result in technical debt in the form of decreased code quality.</p>
								<p>There are gray areas that will require consideration, however. An example would be
									supporting documentation. We propose including supporting items in this gray area if
									they are considered a tangible extension of the technical asset. If a software
									package were to be purchased from a vendor, one would expect system documentation to
									be a part of that package. Therefore, gaps in system documentation could be
									considered debt.</p>
								<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
								<p>Regardless of how accurate the perception might be, technology departments are viewed
									as being out of touch with the rest of the business in many organizations. Part of
									the reason behind this is because technology and business departments have
									historically viewed the world through different lenses. Unsurprisingly, challenges
									and potential solutions often appear different from various vantage points. Issues
									surrounding software quality are no exception. Business and technology professionals
									alike must understand and react to issues affecting both intrinsic and extrinsic
									quality. As we discussed previously, software quality components are hopelessly
									intertwined.</p>
								<p>The definitional framework proposed in this paper accounts for this interdependence
									by describing issues affecting quality with equal emphasis. Tying the definition to
									required levels of quality creates a value-based view which is well aligned with the
									stakeholder’s perspective. Enabling stakeholders to evaluate and manage quality
									related challenges consistently will allow more effective collaboration towards a
									common goal. This is the first step towards a centralized governance model where
									controls like credit limits could be established to better align the risk/reward
									decisions with organizational standards. Coalescing the expertise of business,
									technology and risk management resources maximizes effectiveness by creating a
									united front in the battle against technical debt.</p>
