								<p>The cloud, that is. In <a class="external-link"
										href="http://prismlegal.com/legal-market-revival-trends-live-legal-tech-blogger-breakfast/"
										rel="nofollow">Ron Friedmann’s live blog post</a> during LTNY 2015 bloggers
									breakfast, he captures the following conversation between legal IT gurus, Bob
									Ambrogi (Blogger and Former Editor), James Paterson (Lexis Nexis), Ari Kaplan (Legal
									Market Researcher and Writer) and Ryan Mclead (3 Geeks and a Blog):</p>
								<p><strong>How did the cloud play out in 2014 and what will happen in 2015?</strong></p>
								<p><em>Ryan: I am baffled we are still having this discussion. To be sure, there are
										security concerns; but this is true for any system. The cloud is now the
										infrastructure. “The only way to be profitable in this industry is to move to
										the cloud.”</em></p>
								<p><em>James: Cloud wins on ease-of-use, especially in the small law firm market. As
										firms look for more security, many will look to companies what specialize in IT
										– which means the cloud.</em></p>
								<p><em>Bob: We need to declare an end to discussing this. It’s here, get over it.</em>
								</p>
								<p><em>Ari: Interviewed corporate security officers recently. They do not speak with one
										voice. Depends where they come out on security versus convenience. James chimes
										in to say that corporate IT leaders are shifting rapidly to accept if not
										embrace the cloud.</em></p>
								<p>All true and refreshing to hear such candid perspectives on technology that’s here to
									stay. <strong>But to be fair, can we really say that firms themselves are resisting
										cloud adoption?</strong> <strong>Or, is it the clients they serve dictating
										those decisions?</strong></p>
								<p>Some resistance to the cloud is for good reason. Two of the largest industry
									consumers of legal services, Financial and Healthcare, are held to regulatory
									requirements impeding cloud adoption to occur for various aspects of the business.
									Regulatory requirements may prohibit high profile or sensitive data to be stored in
									the cloud, regardless of how secure we prove it to be. Industries aside, practice
									areas such as M&amp;A and IP are also held to extremely high data security
									standards. This is one reason hybrid solutions have become so popular. Firms will
									often migrate less sensitive areas of their infrastructure to the cloud, such as
									calendars, contacts, etc., while storing sensitive data on-prem.</p>
								<p>Other clients may be putting serious pressure on firms to implement security
									initiatives for added protection, such as: encryption technologies, multi-factor
									authentication and ethical wall protection. The 2014 ILTA Technology Survey reports
									that initiatives like MDM (mobile device management) are up 12 points in the past
									two years, with encryption technologies, multi-factor authentication and ethical
									wall protection all showing an increase as well. Security awareness programs are
									also up 12 points, according to the survey.</p>
								<p>With that said, I am encouraged by the momentum of cloud adoption that is taking
									place. Over the past 12 months, I’ve seen about 60-70% of our new engagements (mid
									to large-sized firms) moving in that direction. Not all firms are created equal
									which often present unique challenges or concerns when moving to the cloud – this
									alone is reason enough for lingering cloud adoption and education. This year, my
									focus for our ILTA Roadshows is addressing SharePoint Online Versus On-Prem and
									guiding firms on which option best suits their needs; the cloud is here to stay, but
									it doesn’t necessarily mean it is right for every firm and every situation.</p>
								<p><strong>What else happened at LTNY</strong></p>
								<p>Matter Center was not unveiled at LTNY as many had expected leaving ILTA last year,
									and continues to be held close to Microsoft’s chest for now; more information is
									suspected to be revealed in April. You can learn more about where Matter Center
									stands today in our recent <a class="external-link"
										href="../../assets/files/DavisTheo.pdf"
										rel="nofollow">Peer to Peer article</a>.</p>
								<p><a class="external-link"
										href="http://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2015/01/20/microsoft-acquires-equivio-provider-machine-learning-powered-compliance-solutions/"
										rel="nofollow">The acquisition of Equivio</a> and what this means for SharePoint
									and Matter Center also remains quiet for now.</p>
								<p><a class="external-link" href="http://www.netdocuments.com/"
										rel="nofollow">netdocuments </a>was of particular interest given their recent <a
										class="external-link" href="http://blog.netdocuments.com/blog/frontier"
										rel="nofollow">$25MM influx of capital</a> and three new strategic hires,  Bobby
									Tindel (VP of Service Delivery), Ed Bergstrom (Director of Global Channel Sales) and
									Wayne Harris (SVP of Global Sales). We look forward to our ongoing relationship and
									improving our NetDocs app for SharePoint integration.  Congratulations on your new
									roles, Bobby, Ed and Wayne!</p>
								<p>Lexis Nexis promoted its new product, <a class="external-link"
										href="http://www.moreover.com/newsdesk" rel="nofollow">Newsdesk</a>, from its
									October 2014 <a class="external-link"

									content delivery service and provider. With more than 250 million current news
									items, advanced filtering, email alert and newsletter functionality, analytics and
									more, the product preview was a success among attendees with added API functionality
									for SharePoint integration.</p>
								<p>Handshake Software promoted its latest tool, <a class="external-link"
