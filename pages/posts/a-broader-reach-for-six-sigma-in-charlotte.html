								<p>A Charlotte law firm and a manufacturer’s assembly line don’t have much in common.
									But for both, the pressure to eliminate errors and increase efficiency is the
									driving force behind a continued attraction to Six Sigma management
									methodology.<span id="more-1456"></span></p>
								<p>“I, like probably everyone in the legal field, had never heard about Six Sigma,” says
									Matt Hunoval, an attorney who leads the only law firm in the region — if not the
									country — known to be applying the methodology to the practice of law.</p>
								<p>“But the more I saw, I noticed overlap with what we do,” he adds. “To the extent that
									there is some similarity between manufacturing and a high-volume, process-driven law
									firm, there’s got to be some benefit to be derived.”</p>
								<p>Six Sigma is a process tool that was introduced to improve the quality of
									manufactured goods. In the last decade, the methodology spread to the
									financial-services sector, where it was credited with giving Bank of America Corp.
									an edge in its performance.</p>
								<p>But the recession and many businesses’ failed attempts at the practice have prompted
									some to ask if the approach is still relevant.</p>
								<p>The Hunoval Law Firm is part of a new generation of Six Sigma practitioners who say
									the methodology has produced measurable results and makes a company more attractive
									to its customers.</p>
								<p>“Our biggest client base is large financial institutions, and we are speaking their
									language,” Hunoval says. “This is in the DNA of all of our clients. When we started
									talking to clients about what we were doing, they were like, ‘Holy (expletive),
									here’s a lawyer who finally gets it.’ We’re the only law firm that has embraced this
									top to bottom.”<br />
									￼<br />
									The firm partnered with Charlotte consulting firm Acrowire and UNC Charlotte’s
									Center for Lean Logistics and Engineered Systems to apply Six Sigma principles to
									the high-volume, process- driven real estate closing and foreclosure process. To
									date, 15% of the law firm’s 70 employees have earned green-belt certification, and
									by year end that figure will double.</p>
								<p>Kevin Divine, director of Lean Six Sigma for the law firm, says the approach has
									shaved 30 days from the cycle of bank-owned properties returning to the market for
									sale. That kind of result appeals to clients, including giant mortgage servicers. In
									three years, the firm has seen revenue increase 1,200%, due in part to demand for
									legal services for loan defaults during that time, but also because of process
									improvements. The company had seven employees in 2010 but now has more than 70.</p>
								<p>“There is a tendency to view it as gimmicky stuff, but the data speaks for itself,”
									Hunoval says. Bank of America was on the forefront of nonindustrial businesses
									adopting the principles. Former Chief Executive Ken Lewis [4] announced a major
									shift in strategy by the bank to use the methodology to correct errors in 2002. It
									resulted in a 70% reduction in missing items from customer statements, among other
									accomplishments. The bank declined to discuss its involvement with the process.</p>
								<p>Six Sigma still enjoys respect in industry, although Lean, which focuses on improving
									process flow rather than eliminating errors, has gained ground. A 2013 report from
									executive-search firm The Avery Point Group says demand for specialists in
									continuous improvement has more than doubled from 2010. While Lean tends to be the
									dominant skill required within job postings, Six Sigma is rebounding, the report
									says.</p>
								<p>Izzy Sanchez and Ian Cato, former Bank of America Six Sigma experts, launched Lean
									Sigma Professionals in 2008, just as the recession hit. “It was really the best time
									to go out because companies were in a world of hurt and they needed to do more with
									less,” Sanchez says. “We went to market with that in mind. It was not about selling
									Six Sigma. It was about a business getting better with what they do.”</p>
								<p>The firm offers training for Six Sigma as well as project implementation. It has
									grown to 23 consultants. In 2011, the company was named a supplier of the year by
									the U.S. Postal Service. As Six Sigma’s methodology was applied across industries,
									companies had varying degrees of success. Some improved, but others did not.</p>
								<p>Sanchez and Cato, both with manufacturing experience, say disappointing results stem
									from unreasonable expectations and flawed implementation. “A lot of companies go
									down this path with a cheerleader at the top but never define what that’s going to
									mean,” Cato says. “People forget the reasons. Some opt in and some opt out, and
									three years later they conclude it didn’t work.”</p>
								<p>Those embracing Six Sigma today are late adopters, but they have watched it work when
									done correctly and seen the power Six Sigma has to make processes consistently
									error-free, advocates say. Industry adoption of Six Sigma is broader than it was a
									decade ago, even if it isn’t always referred to as Six Sigma. Health-care providers,
									many manufacturers and some municipalities are applying the principles.</p>
								<p>Lean Sigma Professionals offers project-implementation services. A small team works
									with a client’s employees who will continue to shepherd the project after the
									consulting engagement ends. The company also offers training for companies that want
									to develop in-house expertise.</p>
								<p>Sacha Soja, program director for Six Sigma at Central Piedmont Community College,
									says the college saw spikes in interest in 2007 and again in 2010. Interest today
									remains steady, with companies interested in the methodology as part of project
									management and business analysis.</p>
								<p>“A lot of companies jumped on the bandwagon,” Soja says. “It’s obviously a
									metrics-based methodology, and it’s only as good as the data that goes into
									it.” CPCC offers training for all levels of Six Sigma. The yellow-belt certification
									is for students with no exposure to the process. A green belt is certification for
									data collection and analysis for procedures that can be improved. A holder of a
									black belt is qualified to supervise teams of green belts.</p>
								<p>Terry Snider, vice president of business process management for Livingston &amp;
									Haven, a Charlotte- based maker of industrial equipment, says Six Sigma remains in
									high regard in manufacturing. “I think Six Sigma has moved from the board room to
									the shop floor,” Snider says. “I don’t think CEOs are talking about it, but I do
									think people are implementing it where they can.”</p>
