								<p><span style="color: #676767;">The Project Management Institute defines risk as “an
										uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative
										effect on a project’s objectives.” Unpredictability in any direction — the
										hallmark of risk — is undesirable. Law firms often seek to bolster technology in
										order to lessen unpredictability, but it is not necessarily the technology that
										needs to be improved. It is time to dig deeper and use the power of Six Sigma to
										correct the root of the problem in your practice — the underlying processes that
										the technology supports.</span></p>
								<p><span style="color: #676767;">Six Sigma is a statistically driven and disciplined
										framework that aims to improve processes, minimize errors/defects and reduce
										variations. An expert trained in the Six Sigma process governs both individual
										steps and the process as a whole by using a structured project plan that acts as
										a blueprint for implementing Six Sigma initiatives toward the goal of
										predictability. Six Sigma can be initiated both for new processes (i.e., design
										for Six Sigma) and for existing processes (i.e., improvement projects).</span>
								</p>
								<p><strong><span style="color: #676767;">SIX SIGMA AND RISK MANAGEMENT </span></strong>
								</p>
								<p><span style="color: #676767;">Protecting sensitive data is not only part of client
										expectations but mandated by ethics rules, creating the utmost accountability
										and pressure on law firms to implement preventive measures. According to the
										2013 ILTA Technology Survey, security and risk management are among the top
										concerns for law firms, which handle sensitive client information, business
										strategies and intellectual property. This puts them at higher risk of
										inadvertently exposing sensitive data than companies in many other industries.
										Law enforcement has long worried that law firms are not doing enough to guard
										against intrusions by hackers. In fact, in 2011, the Federal Bureau of
										Investigation began organizing meetings with top law firms in major cities to
										highlight the issue of computer security and corporate espionage, according to
										“Law Firms Are Pressed on Security for Data,” an article that appeared in The
										New York Times in March 2014. </span></p>
								<p><span style="color: #676767;">The Six Sigma methodology works directly to mitigate
										this risk. It provides a proven formula for achieving predictable outcomes as
										well as risk management tools to quantify and prioritize risks. IT departments
										that leverage the Six Sigma framework take a disciplined approach to managing
										change in their environments. Where risks are present, corresponding controls
										are implemented to ensure that processes are put in place to mitigate and offset
										those risks. In addition, the risks and controls are documented and vetted by
										key stakeholders, a feature which is foundational to any mature risk management
										program. </span></p>
								<p><span style="color: #676767;">Whether they come internally or externally, risks to
										information security are always present and ever-changing. It is often the
										seemingly obvious and mundane areas of the IT environment that create the most
										risk, such as inadequate password policies or users running out-of-date
										software. While these gaps seem glaring to any seasoned security professional,
										they still persist in the legal services industry.</span></p>
								<p><span style="color: #676767;">These common security risks are often addressed within
										a proper desktop management program. Leveraging the Six Sigma framework to
										design this program forces it to be thoroughly vetted and designed to implement
										the appropriate controls. Let’s walk through the very basic process of password
										resets to show how Six Sigma tools could be leveraged to maximize security. To
										be clear, re-engineering a discreet process of this scope normally would not be
										done independently but would be part of a broader initiative. We are zeroing in
										on this sub-process to show how Six Sigma works. </span></p>
								<p><span style="color: #676767;">One of the more common approaches to password resets is
										to provide a portal where users unable to access their corporate email accounts
										can request that a temporary password be sent to an alternative email address.
										During the first phase of a Six Sigma initiative, the project team maps steps of
										the existing processes. The password reset process map might look something like
										this:</span></p>
								<p><a
										href="../../assets/images/graphic-1-ss-e1416420225946.png"><img
											loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2067"
											src="../../assets/images/graphic-1-ss-e1416420225946.png"
											alt="graphic 1 ss" width="500" height="111" /></a></p>
								<p>In subsequent project phases, the team evaluates the risk inherent in the process
									using tools like the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA). The FMEA evolved
									from work done at NASA where the interest in preventing failures is extremely high.
									The FMEA identifies “failure modes” as ways in which processes could fail. For each
									process step, the project team evaluates what could go wrong. As failure modes are
									identified, they are evaluated across three different dimensions, typically on a
									scale of one to five:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><span style="color: #676767;">The severity of the failure</span></li>
									<li><span style="color: #676767;">The likelihood of occurrence</span></li>
									<li><span style="color: #676767;">The probability anyone would detect the
											failure</span></li>
								</ul>
								<p><span style="color: #676767;">These three numbers are then multiplied to calculate a
										risk priority number (RPN): </span></p>
								<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #676767;">RPN = Severity * Occurrence
										* Detection </span></p>
								<p><span style="color: #676767;">Failure modes are prioritized in descending order based
										on their RPN. Those with higher RPNs are put at the top of the list, either the
										process is re-engineered or a control plan is put in place to mitigate the risk.
									</span></p>
								<p><span style="color: #676767;">Looking back to our password reset process, there are a
										few potential failure modes in step two. For example, a user’s alternative email
										address could be compromised, or a hacker sniffing network traffic could
										intercept the unencrypted temporary password.</span></p>
								<p><a href="../../assets/images/graphic-2-ss.png"><img
											loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2068"
											src="../../assets/images/graphic-2-ss.png"
											alt="graphic 2 ss" width="500" height="318"
											srcset="../../assets/images/graphic-2-ss.png 851w, ../../assets/images/graphic-2-ss-300x190.png 300w"
											sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
								<p><span style="color: #676767;">Many risk management organizations establish RPN
										thresholds that require teams to implement controls or re-engineer processes for
										high-risk failure modes. If the organization in our example chose to implement
										risk mitigation for any RPN over 27, then the process would be re-engineered
										with an additional step to mitigate the risk by presenting challenge questions
										to the user, creating a two-factor authentication mechanism: something you have
										(i.e., access to the alternative email account) and something you know (i.e.,
										answers to the challenge questions). The new password reset process would now
										have a new step two added to the workflow:</span></p>
								<p><a href="../../assets/images/graphic-3-ss.png"><img
											loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2069"
											src="../../assets/images/graphic-3-ss.png"
											alt="graphic 3 ss" width="500" height="123"
											srcset="../../assets/images/graphic-3-ss.png 913w, ../../assets/images/graphic-3-ss-300x73.png 300w"
											sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
								<p>This simplistic example uses an easy-to-understand vulnerability to illustrate the
									tools that Six Sigma provides. The real value of the framework is derived when the
									tools are used to design processes with many moving parts and less obvious failure
									modes. Because Six Sigma forces practitioners to evaluate processes in a formal way
									and identify and prioritize risks systematically, it allows organizations to ensure
									all parts of processes are scrutinized and vetted by relevant stakeholders.</p>
