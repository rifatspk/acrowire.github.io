								<p>Technical debt is a subject that is getting a lot of attention lately. <a
										href="http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1439513">Gartner estimates global
										technical debt at $500 Billion</a> and projects it to reach $1 Trillion in five
									years. Surprisingly, however, technical debt is a concept that many people in
									business and technology fail to fully understand. The reason this lack of
									understanding is so surprising is the magnitude of the problem and the fact that
									almost every business has (or will have) technical debt and regularly pays interest
									on it. On the surface, the concept of technical debt is very simple. The term <a
										href="http://c2.com/doc/oopsla92.html">was coined by Ward Cunningham in
										1992</a> to describe the costs associated with maintaining and enhancing a
									platform where shortcuts were taken in the design or implementation in order to meet
									financial or timeline objectives. Examples of these shortcuts include failure to do
									the following:</p>
								<p>· document system architectures</p>
								<p>· provide adequate code coverage in QA processes</p>
								<p>· implement standards and conventions</p>
								<p>· properly understand the technologies leveraged</p>
								<p>· properly understanding the processes the technology is designed to support</p>
								<p>· refactor code base or architecture to meet changing needs</p>
								<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqeJFYwnkjE">Cunningham followed up with a
										brief video</a> to further describe and clarify the concept in 2009. The debt
									metaphor he describes fits surprisingly well. Just as in finance, debt can provide a
									valuable tool to expand more rapidly than you would be able to otherwise. However,
									if you accumulate too much debt the majority of your resources will need to focus on
									servicing that debt. One can think of the principal amount of the technical debt as
									the cost associated with fixing the problem and the interest as any business cost
									associated with the shortcomings. The loss in productivity a programmer might
									experience enhancing an undocumented application is an example of interest.</p>
								<p>The key difference between financial and technical debt is that the former is usually
									very visible and easy to quantify while the latter is not. There aren’t any
									financial calculators that allow you to input a few parameters and have it calculate
									a number that tells you how much technical debt you have. When you assume technical
									debt you are acquiring an asset (working software) at a lower expense (in terms of
									time or capital) than the true cost of the asset. The gap between the price paid and
									the true cost represents the technical debt.</p>
								<p>Organizations with mature risk management practices will often track these types of
									technology gaps in a centralized way. However, few have formal governance processes
									to identify, quantify, prioritize, and resolve technical debt in an effective and
									coordinated way. Even if those processes exist they usually reside in different
									areas of the organization (i.e. internal audit, operational risk management, etc.)
									and coordination becomes difficult. I will talk about each of these processes in
									detail in subsequent posts.</p>
								<p><strong>Strategic Debt</strong></p>
								<p>There are several types of technical debt and some have even attempted to create <a
										href="http://blogs.construx.com/blogs/stevemcc/archive/2007/11/01/technical-debt-2.aspx">a
										taxonomy</a> to classify it. However, at a high level the most important
									distinction is the difference between strategic and nonstrategic technical debt.
									Strategic debt describes situations where tradeoffs are made in a proactive and
									measured way. One might wonder why anyone would choose to make compromises that will
									have consequences down the road. The two most common reasons debt is accumulated is
									to save money and/or time. It can make perfectly good sense to take shortcuts to get
									across the goal line when there is a limited budget or time to market is a big
									concern.</p>
								<p>What makes debt strategic is the fact that the pros and cons were evaluated and an
									informed decision was made by the appropriate stakeholders to assume and manage the
									debt to help meet strategic objectives. It is important to recognize that just
									because someone was aware of the technical debt beforehand and made a conscious
									decision to assume it does not make it strategic. For example, the debt created when
									a development manager decides on his own to postpone documenting the system his team
									is building until after implementation cannot be considered strategic to the
									organization. It may be strategic to that particular manager’s objectives but may be
									in conflict with the interests of the organization as a whole.</p>
								<p>The decision to assume the debt must be explicit and made by key stakeholders based
									on a reasonably accurate assessment of the risks and rewards contained therein.
									Additionally, process must exist to manage technical debt to ensure that it
									maintains visibility and is paid back at the appropriate point in time. Any debt
									that does not meet these criteria cannot be considered strategic. Below is a
									scenario which describes strategic technical debt.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>An emerging opportunity has been identified and the ability to fully capitalize
										is directly tied to the organization’s ability to deliver a timely solution.
										There is also a limited amount of budget allocated to providing a production
										ready solution. To meet project goals, an open source platform which allows
										rapid application development is chosen. However, the platform has not been
										proven to support the volume which would be eventually required if best case
										projections materialize.</p>
									<p>The potential gap the platform brings to the table is discussed with stakeholders
										and without the reduced cost and shorter timeline the architecture provides it
										will not be possible to move forward. To mitigate the risk, the company assigns
										resources to closely monitor usage and routines are put in place where senior
										leaders meet twice a month to evaluate revised projections. If and when the
										projections indicate that the platform might not be able to support usage, the
										plan to migrate to the long term architecture will be executed.</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p><strong>Nonstrategic Debt</strong></p>
								<p>While assuming strategic technical debt to help meet objectives can be in the
									organization’s best interest, assuming nonstrategic debt almost always is not.
									Nonstrategic technical debt describes situations where gaps are created without
									stakeholder approval and the implications to strategic objectives aren’t properly
									considered. The sources of nonstrategic debt are numerous but often result from
									process deficiencies.</p>
								<p>One frequent source of nonstrategic technical debt is low quality code. Sometimes
									code is written poorly right out of the gate because standards and conventions
									aren’t enforced and QA processes don’t exist. A more common reason code quality
									suffers is because shortcuts often must be taken to meet the time constraints
									usually associated with enhancement requests.</p>
								<p>In software development, system requirements change often. This change can be due to
									real changes in the environment or our understanding of it. As the environment
									changes or our understanding of it evolves, the code we write must be modified to
									support that. These modifications can make systems complicated and difficult to
									support if routines aren’t put in place to refactor code when necessary. It is
									natural that systems are complex but real challenges can arise when they become
									complicated. There is a distinct difference between complexity and complicatedness
									and <a
										href="http://deepfreeze9.blogspot.com/2007/09/software-complex-vs-complicated.html">much
										has been written on why the distinction is important</a>.</p>
								<p>I will dive deeper into governance in a subsequent article but it makes sense to
									point out that that many sources of nonstrategic technical debt such as poor code
									quality can be managed or avoided. By adopting development processes that embrace
									change and put an emphasis on code quality is critical. Many Agile processes
									implement controls to mitigate the risk of poor code quality. Extreme programming
									(XP), for example, leverages pair programming where developers write code in pairs
									which increases code quality by having the benefit of two different perspectives on
									how to solve technical challenges. The Scrum development methodology requires that a
									“product owner” who represents the business and QA resources play active roles
									directly in the development process. Alignment to business objectives and quality
									are baked directly into the development process instead of being an afterthought.
								</p>
								<p><strong>Organizational Agreement</strong></p>
								<p>It is important to point out that technical debt means different things to different
									people. How much agreement you need to get across your organization depends on what
									you plan to do with the inventory of technical debt once you go about compiling it.
									Regardless if you are creating an inventory to manage it discretely within a small
									development team or creating an enterprise wide governance initiative, it is
									important that business stakeholders buy into the definition.</p>
								<p>The ultimate goal of defining and identifying debt is to manage it. Including
									business partners early in the process is key because once the technical debt is
									identified and measured, remediation efforts will need to be prioritized along with
									other enhancement requests. Business partners are much more likely to trade off
									implementing new features for paying back the debt if they’re included early in the
									process. Vetting out the definition with the business will help you stay on the
									right path as you go about turning over rocks.</p>
								<p><a href="http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1439513">Gartner defines IT
										debt</a> as the cost of clearing the backlog of maintenance that would be
									required to bring the corporate applications portfolio to a fully supported current
									release state. While this definition is broad a lot is left to interpretation. A
									critical question becomes what does “fully supported current release state” really
									mean? If the application itself is free of technical debt but there are quality
									issues in the underlying data does that qualify as technical debt using the Gartner
									definition? What if those data quality issues are from upstream systems and you’re
									paying interest on someone else’s debt?</p>
								<p>Something else to be aware of is that most definitions of technical debt available
									today focus on workarounds that were implemented during the development process.
									Your business partners may want to cast the net wider than the traditional
									definition and include technology risk related items such as control weaknesses.
									Coming to a consensus on a definition with the folks who are writing the checks
									(i.e. business partners) and prioritizing the backlog will pay dividends during the
									remediation process.</p>
								<p><strong>Implications</strong></p>
								<p>The debt metaphor is an important tool in understanding and communicating the
									implications of technical debt. Using this metaphor, <strong>free cash
										flow</strong> can be thought of as the amount of resources available to maintain
									and enhance systems. Cash flow is a finite resource that must be allocated
									carefully. Failing to understand how much of that cash flow is being spent servicing
									technical debt can lead to poor decisions on where to most effectively invest. This
									could eventually lead to <strong>technical bankruptcy </strong>where all an
									organization’s resources are spent dealing with the inefficiencies created by the
									debt they have accumulated and they can no longer keep up.</p>
								<p>While reaching the point of bankruptcy is an extreme case, I have seen very real
									examples of this scenario first hand. Once an organization comes close to having
									this level of debt there can be devastating consequences. Even if systems are
									completely internal, impacts to customer service usually arise. Just like financial
									bankruptcy, sometimes the magnitude of the underlying issues are so severe that it
									becomes impossible to emerge. In the worst case scenarios, systems have to be
									scrapped and rewritten, entire departments are outsourced, customers and market
									share are lost and shareholders lose confidence. Therefore, it is critical that
									organizations create a plan to proactively deal with this phenomena.</p>
								<p><strong>In my next article I will discuss how to identify technical debt within an
										organization. Subsequent articles will discuss the rest of activities in
										managing the lifecycle including quantifying, resolving and governing technical
										debt.</strong></p>
