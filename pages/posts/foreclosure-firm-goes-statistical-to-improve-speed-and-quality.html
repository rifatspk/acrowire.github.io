								<p>Matt Hunoval felt bored to his marrow as a big-firm associate in the nation’s No. 2
									banking capital, Charlotte, N.C.—doing due diligence, preparing ancillary documents
									and performing other drudge work for billion-dollar M&amp;A deals. So despite making
									more money than he figured a fifth-year associate is worth, he left in 2009 to do
									what seemed even more perfunctory—handling flat-fee residential foreclosures by
									himself.</p>
								<p>He had certainly honed the skills for exacting tasks at his old employer, Moore &amp;
									Van Allen, and now pored over every line of the documents in his new field:
									affidavit of default, substitution of trustee, trustee’s deed, deed of trust and
									notice of hearing. The work excited him.</p>
								<p>But Hunoval’s story is a bit richer than the simple irony of walking away from
									comfortable monotony to take a chance on even greater tedium with decidedly less
									glamour. And he doesn’t shy away from criticism of his chosen practice and the
									checkered history of foreclosures.</p>
								<p>The industry is ridding itself of the scandalous, robo-signing foreclosure mills that
									faked documents to prop up questionable mortgages, though court battles continue
									over whether many of the tens of millions of mortgages bundled and securitized for
									sale to investors during the housing boom-and-bubble still have questionable chains
									of ownership.</p>
								<p>But for Hunoval there is the legitimate and necessary business of foreclosure that
									someone is going to do, and he wants to be known for the best way to make the
									process swift and true. If he does it well, he figures, some who might otherwise be
									foreclosed on because of an occasional mistake in the vortex of volume could be
									saved by his attention to detail.</p>
								<p>“Even before you start to tell the story, the narrative is set and we’re the guy in
									the black hat riding in on a black horse,” says Hunoval, who gets referrals from
									half a dozen clients, including mortgage servicers, banks and small hedge funds.
									“But if we reduce error rates, it helps our clients, who don’t want to foreclose
									when it’s not merited. They want to service the loan. And that’s good for the
									debtor.”</p>
								<p>For the first years, he had only one major client, a “whale” as he calls one of the
									top 10 mortgage servicers in the nation, in addition to some “bluefish” and
									“minnows.” More recently Hunoval landed two more whales.</p>
								<p>Hunoval’s firm has grown quickly to 70 employees—nine of them carefully picked
									lawyers, some with particularly beneficial backgrounds and experience for the boss’s
									vision. Those numbers include a cushion for handling the new, big clients, and he
									estimates the staff could grow to 90 by the end of the year.</p>
								<p>While he hasn’t gotten much notice in the legal profession, Hunoval’s approach is
									attracting the studied gaze of the business world for the programmatic, systematic
									efficiencies that, as he puts it, he’s building into his firm’s DNA from the
									lowliest clerk to his highest-paid lawyer.</p>

								<h3>FASTER, CLEANER</h3>
								<p>In January, for instance, Hunoval’s chief information officer, Kevin Divine, attended
									the noted PEX Week (short for Process Excellence) annual gathering in Orlando, Fla.,
									to present a case study of the firm’s rapid achievements in running a foreclosure
									firm faster with fewer mistakes.</p>
								<p>A nugget: In the firm’s first concentrated effort at new efficiencies that began in
									January 2013, it achieved an impressive 88 percent decrease in the number of days it
									takes from the time a North Carolina foreclosure referral arrives until it files the
									notice of hearing that begins the process in the courts. An average of 69 days was
									whittled to just eight.</p>
								<p>Divine’s presentation was bracketed by speeches by the likes of DuPont, Google
									AdWords, Coca-Cola, ConocoPhillips, State Farm and Lilly Research
									Laboratories—entities with names far more recognizable than that of the Hunoval Law
									Firm. They all talked about change in the way their work is done.</p>
								<p>“But this is not about change in how we practice law,” says Hunoval, 40. “It’s about
									law practice management, improving the business side—an idea that is changing how
									law firms can be run.”</p>
								<p>Indeed, you’re more likely to hear him utter terms like low-end functionality and
									scalability rather than those like interlocutory or purchase agreement.</p>
								<p>“To the extent we are ‘a mill,’ then we can use a very successful, widely adopted
									management tool from the manufacturing realm,” Hunoval says.</p>
								<p>That tool would be LSS, for Lean Six Sigma.</p>
								<p>The data- and metric-driven approach to process improvement first developed by Toyota
									took hold in the U.S. with Motorola’s adoption of Six Sigma for manufacturing in the
									early 1980s. It is best known for General Electric’s then-chairman Jack Welch
									embracing it as a main business strategy in 1995. (Divine earned his LSS black belt,
									a certification of expertise in the methodology, at GE in 2000, and he was on its
									eight-person team outsourced to run Xerox’s notoriously chaotic back-office
									invoicing, billing and collections in 2003, a significant factor in pulling Xerox
									out of a sinkhole of debt.)</p>
								<p>Six Sigma concerns quality control for fewer defects or mistakes. Lean is a
									methodology for finding and eliminating wasted effort. In recent years the Lean
									aspect has regained its earlier luster as various service industries have adopted
									what first was a manufacturing practice for streamlining processes.</p>
								<p>Hunoval’s clients are primarily large financial institutions that—like others in
									manufacturing, construction, engineering and pharmaceuticals—adopted some version of
									Six Sigma 20 or more years ago. It’s in their cultures.</p>
								<p>“When they hear us speaking that same language,” Hunoval says, “I can see the
									lightbulb moment where the client or potential client says, “Oh my god, here’s a
									lawyer who actually gets it.”</p>

								<h3>HIGH ACHIEVER</h3>
								<p>Though Hunoval started out as a big-firm lawyer, he doesn’t come across like one. He
									does, though, have the bona fides: just in case Wake Forest University School of
									Law’s tie for No. 36 in the U.S. News rankings in 2003 wasn’t enough for an initial
									career boost, he went straight to the New York University School of Law for an LLM
									before entering practice. That diploma is, he says, “the most expensive piece of art
									on my wall.”</p>
								<p>Hunoval was initially drawn to transactional work, which belied his roiling energy,
									presence and manner, more like those of a bare-knuckled litigator who doesn’t want
									to settle. Besides being blunt-spoken with often earthy phraseology, he’s 6-foot-2,
									beefy and cut like a linebacker, having played football in high school and then
									rugby until he was 32, when the physical recovery period between weekly matches
									itself grew to a week. He is given to three-piece suits and his trademark Lucchese
									cowboy boots, handmade in Texas.</p>
								<p>The seemingly unavoidable swagger is muted. His aggressive agility in growing a
									business is not.</p>
								<p>It appeared likely in the economic straits of 2009 that the spate of foreclosures
									would be a geyser without the on-and-off intervals. That was in the air when Hunoval
									got a call in March 2009 from a close friend he roomed with in their fraternity
									house at Davidson College, someone who worked for a nationwide mortgage servicing
									company. The friend was having problems with some law firms handling foreclosures in
									the Carolinas and asked whether Hunoval was interested in getting into that
									practice.</p>
								<p>“He said, ‘Just get a paralegal who’s been in this for eight to 10 years and you’ll
									learn it quickly,’ ” recalls Hunoval, sitting in his office decorated with furniture
									as oddly fashioned as it is distinctive: two desks, a bookshelf and club chairs made
									of polished aluminum riveted together in a patchwork reminiscent of WWII fighter
									planes—scrapes, dings and all.</p>
								<p>By that summer he and paralegal Cara Clausen (now the firm’s director of legal
									operations) got a dozen or so foreclosure referrals, and he applied his
									M&amp;A-acquired attention to detail.</p>
								<p>“We were making almost no mistakes, and I was personally looking at every line of
									every document we turned out, with some very favorable results for clients,” Hunoval
									says. “Once the mortgage servicer decides to foreclose, time is everything and
									mistakes devour time.”</p>
								<h3>AN ALL-LEAN STAFF</h3>
								<p>As Hunoval grew his own business from scratch, it was perhaps the most significant in
									a series of bold moves when he had, as he puts it in business-speak, “25 W-2s”
									working for him and decided to have every one of them, from the lowliest clerk to
									his highest-paid lawyer, trained in LSS for process improvement.</p>
								<p>He wanted to separate himself from the small pack of law firms handling foreclosures
									in North Carolina, with an eye to South Carolina and more. He’s still probably No. 4
									in volume but believes his growth curve will continue, and the firm is diversifying
									into other kinds of work.</p>
								<p>Hunoval had learned of LSS from a personal friend, Ted Theodoropoulos, whose company
									Acrowire helped develop the law firm’s IT system—and who also happens to be an LSS
									black belt who works with law firms on process improvement.</p>
								<p>“With such a highly commoditized practice like default service, Lean Six Sigma seemed
									a perfect match—except to a lot of law firms,” says Theodoropoulos, who did process
									management for Bank of America before going out on his own. “Matt wasn’t tied up by
									having done things a certain way for so long that he couldn’t imagine a better way.
									He got it.”</p>
								<p>Divine was with Acrowire and soon embedded in Hunoval’s offices, eventually becoming
									another of its W-2s.</p>
								<p>Then Hunoval made another of his typical leaps. He approached professors at the
									Center for Lean Logistics and Engineered Systems at the University of North Carolina
									at Charlotte and sold them on the idea of the legal profession as new territory for
									them. Lean training focuses on process efficiency more than the curing of defects
									addressed by Six Sigma.</p>
								<p>“I appealed to their self-interest with a chance to change an entire industry that
									involves billions of dollars,” Hunoval says. Beginning in late 2012, Hunoval has
									sent six to seven staffers at a time to the school for Lean training based on real
									projects being developed for the firm.</p>
								<p>They attend UNCC for full days of class each Friday for five weeks, earning green
									belt certifications. Typically, a green belt has gained a practical understanding of
									the methods for analyzing processes and using certain tools to improve them; black
									belts can fully design, implement and supervise projects in which those skills are
									applied, as well as teach and mentor.</p>
								<p>By the end of 2013 a third of the staff had completed the program, and a full 70
									percent is expected to by the end of 2014. The first project addressed the overly
									long process for a notice of hearing and achieved the impressive 88 percent timeline
									improvement.</p>

								<p>“It helps that he’s doing this as a startup, when his firm is young,” says Ertunga
									Ozelkan, associate director of the Lean logistics center, who co-authored a
									scholarly paper on the firm’s efforts presented in September in Atlanta at the
									Institute of Industrial Engineers’ annual Engineering Lean &amp; Six Sigma
									Conference. It won second place in competition among 50 entries.</p>
								<p>But it’s not that Lean or LSS can’t be adopted in a long-established law firm.</p>
								<p>For example, Seyfarth Shaw, with more than 800 lawyers, began developing in 2008 what
									became its SeyfarthLean program, after clients started asking for alternative fee
									arrangements. For what is called continuous improvement, the firm’s SeyfarthLean
									team regularly cycles through each department looking for ways to improve work
									processes: better, faster, cheaper.</p>
								<p>The 65-lawyer, full-service Barley Snyder firm with offices in central Pennsylvania
									also began targeting efficiency in the mid-2000s, eventually embracing Lean Six
									Sigma. But LSS still is one of those business management programs whose mention
									(except to the cognoscenti) tends to elicit a kind of skeptical laughter reserved
									for catchphrase gimmicks.</p>
								<p>“I’d have the same knee-jerk reaction that this is hocus-pocus BS,” says Hunoval.
									“But the results just blew me away. There is a little hokiness to it, but the damn
									thing works. So I like the skepticism. Strategically it means we can be out in front
									for a bit before it catches on among law firms.”</p>

								<h3>MARRIED TO THE FIRM</h3>
								<p>While Hunoval’s own office is devoid of any sense of a woman’s touch, there is one in
									the firm’s leadership. His wife, Christi, left her litigation practice in the
									Charlotte office of South Carolina’s biggest firm, Nelson Mullins Riley &amp;
									Scarborough, in the summer of 2012 to join her husband’s venture. The two met when
									they were associates in Nelson Mullins’ Columbia, S.C., office, before he moved on
									to other firms in Charlotte.</p>
								<p>Christi Hunoval, a South Carolina native, is a steel magnolia “with major litigation
									chops,” as her husband puts it. She runs the litigation department with two other
									lawyers and some paralegals, accounting for 7 percent of revenues last year, which
									Matt expects to increase by half next year. Last May, former Nelson Mullins
									colleague Brian Calub, who clerked for a U.S. bankruptcy court judge, came to the
									firm as its managing litigation attorney.</p>
								<p>“We’re working to overcome the mindset that a foreclosure firm can’t also handle
									litigation, that they need to kick the cases over to a litigation firm,” Christi
									says. “It’s frustrating to see cases yanked when we already had the institutional
									knowledge working the default and thought we could have done them better.”</p>
								<p>A lot of the litigation is started by debtors representing themselves, often using
									templates found online or obtained from lawyers for complaints and other filings,
									though bankruptcy and other consumer-oriented lawyers bring cases, too.</p>
								<p>Christi Hunoval is now the firm’s managing member, with Matt designated as founder.
									That arrangement led to theirs being certified last April as a woman-owned business
									enterprise by the National Women Business Owners Corp.</p>
								<p>Matt Hunoval, though always in a hurry while also trying to heed advice from the
									firm’s finance director, has carefully been putting together a team of lawyers with
									what he sees as added value for the firm itself, more than just lawyering. (He
									hasn’t overspent on growth. His only debt is the mortgage on the firm’s building,
									and he carries a $300,000 line of credit.)</p>
								<p>For example, in March last year Hunoval hired Les Blankenship to run the South
									Carolina default practice. Blankenship had litigated matters for mortgage servicers
									in the Charleston, S.C., office of the Finkel Law Firm, which has a broad practice
									but does the lion’s share of the state’s default work.</p>
								<p>One year earlier, Hunoval hired Cameron Scott, who spent 4 years as an assistant
									clerk in the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County presiding over tens of thousands
									of foreclosure cases, a largely administrative role but a good one for developing
									networks and a big-picture view of the practice statewide. It helps, Hunoval adds,
									that Scott knows the clerks in all 100 North Carolina counties and taught some of
									their continuing education courses.</p>
								<p>What the staff has achieved has already drawn high praise.</p>
								<p>“What Matt Hunoval has accomplished is pretty staggering,” says LSS consultant David
									Skinner, a principal of Gimbal Law Practice Management Advisors, based in Montreal.
									Though he hasn’t worked with the firm, Skinner reads reports of its LSS progress,
									corresponds with Hunoval and believes others in the practice area will be forced to
									take notice.</p>
								<p>Most importantly, Hunoval wants his staff “to buy into it. I want it in the DNA of
									this firm.” That way they can have pride of ownership in their own jobs by getting
									clear knowledge of how their work and that of the others fits together. They don’t
									just fasten widgets on products they don’t understand.</p>
								<p>“We have regular meetings to discuss what everyone is doing in the process,” says Kim
									Langdon, a paralegal with the firm who specializes in South Carolina defaults. “It
									makes us aware of what everybody does, why people do certain things, and why you
									need to do it in the time frame. And there is some cross-training for scalability.
									If things get backed up in one area, someone can come over and help out.”</p>
								<p>Blankenship soon noticed that too many South Carolina draft complaints contained
									errors or lacked documents. And that’s how Langdon’s job came to be changed. She
									used to do the document prep for drafting complaints. Now someone below the level of
									a paralegal handles the time-consuming gathering of documents, freeing up Langdon to
									concentrate on the complaints, and also to follow up on process servers later, which
									had been someone else’s task.</p>
								<p>In January, the firm was one of five finalists for the Best Process Improvement
									Project at the 15th annual PEX awards, along with Capital One and Pitney Bowes—the
									winner. Hunoval’s entry was about changing how work is done.</p>
								<p>“We keep working the bubbles out,” says Hunoval, describing the LSS process of
									continuous improvement. When you create a process map and find several problems,
									first attack the one that might account for 80 percent of the trouble; then start
									over and deal with the next one that rises to that level.</p>
								<p>One of the most noticeable things for a visitor touring the building from department
									to department is the quiet, unhurried atmosphere. It is not a sweatshop. But
									everyone is always aware of targets, goals and needs. It becomes, Langdon says,
									“like a game in which you try to beat your own best time.”</p>
								<p>Large flat-screen monitors mounted on walls in common areas, such as above photocopy
									machines, display color-coded spreadsheets detailing the past month’s workflow and
									totals in various tasks. At the bottom of the screens, graphics that look like
									streaming stock quotes carry status updates on case files, from intake to
									courthouse, showing where they are in each stage of the process and making it easy
									to spot problems that could slow or even halt their work.</p>
								<p>“You can keep a constant check on your progress, and I can maybe adjust what I’m
									doing that day to work on complaints more rather than on amendments to those already
									filed, because it’s crucial to get that first complaint out,” Langdon says. She
									started at the firm in August 2012, before LSS came into play. “The difference has
									been like night and day.”</p>

								<h3>LIMITED ENTRY</h3>
								<p>There are six entrances to the Hunoval firm but no lobby and no receptionist. All
									doors are locked. You don’t come to the offices unless you’re expected.</p>
								<p>The nondescript, 22,000-square-foot office building is tucked into an industrial
									corridor along I-77 in the southern area of Charlotte, 5 miles from the South
									Carolina border. (Hunoval’s business gauge: 70 percent of the key population of the
									Carolinas is within a 1-hour and 45-minute drive.)</p>
								<p>Hunoval moved there a little more than a year after launching his business in a
									300-square-foot, open-cube space. That first office shared amenities and a
									frat-house atmosphere with six or seven other 20- and 30-something tenants—young
									entrepreneurs, including a Web developer and a purveyor of splash-screen ads for
									urinals—along with a refrigerator typically stocked with beer, Mountain Dew and
									mustard.</p>
								<p>Hunoval leased 1,600 square feet in the current location in September 2010. He had
									started out handling 10 to 15 foreclosure files monthly, and in less than six months
									it grew to about 100. When he was offered an opportunity to expand into South
									Carolina, it was time to get bigger space. Now the count is about 500 monthly, with
									significant growth expected from the two new “whales,” if Hunoval’s LSS approach
									suits them.</p>
								<p>Hunoval bought the building outright in October 2012. All entrances to his offices
									have video-recording security cameras, with keycard access only, part of an
									extensive and expensive array—he estimates $400,000—of security measures and
									documentation to ensure compliance with rules and regulations concerning private
									information in foreclosure files.</p>
								<p>Hunoval now uses 75 percent of the building, with only an airline flight-attendants
									union and a cleaning service as his remaining tenants.</p>
								<p>That security infrastructure might soon give Hunoval some advantage in a fast-growing
									sideline to his foreclosure business—real estate closings. It’s more work on the
									same dirt if he can do the foreclosure and then handle the sale. And he has a unique
									approach that appeals to real estate agents and lenders looking for convenience:
									virtual closings.</p>
								<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued new regulations in January requiring
									certain building and data security measures for financial institutions and, in turn,
									those institutions will develop approved lists of law firms that can provide such
									security for records involved in closings.</p>
								<p>“I think it’s going to force onesy and twosy guys who do occasional closings to take
									early retirement or go do something else,” Hunoval says. “And of those left
									standing, we’ll see who is willing or able to make the new, required investment in
									infrastructure. Some of our competitors are run by longtime patriarchs with the
									force of personality and maybe little incentive to make the investments or change
									their cultures. Five years from now, we could be in a very good position.”</p>
								<p>The closing business began as a hedge. Foreclosures have declined in the past year to
									pre-economic collapse levels, and closings are in some ways the other face of that
									coin: When one side is up, the other likely is down. Hunoval’s John Langston is
									pioneering the virtual closings, in which he and another lawyer can attend via
									television screen through an Internet connection, typically in the offices of real
									estate agents. They do about 150 closings monthly, 30 or so virtual. Until last
									summer, roughly 90 percent of them were lender-owned properties. Now, two-thirds of
									the business is ordinary closings.</p>
								<p>“I see this as our real future, frankly,” says Hunoval. North Carolina and South
									Carolina are among a number of states that require lawyer involvement in closings.
									But the practice is balkanized, with one firm typically dominating a particular area
									of a city or county. “I want us to be the first firm with a truly statewide reach.
									I’m betting the farm this will literally transform how closing practice is done in
									the Carolinas.” He has been in talks recently with a large realty company that does
									more than 2,300 closings a year and might want to embed the firm’s virtual
									capabilities in its own office.</p>
								<p>Hunoval has expanded with a toehold office in Virginia and is looking to Maryland
									next. Thus far he has grown by “green fielding,” or building his own, but Maryland
									might mean acquiring another firm.</p>
								<p>And, of course, introducing it to LSS.</p>
								<p>“It’s a question of how you inspire your people, how you get more out of them than
									they think they have,” Hunoval says. “I’ve got to communicate a vision and I’ve got
									to get everyone to buy into it.</p>
								<p>“I’ve drunk the Kool-Aid.”</p>

								<h3>Mapping the Process</h3>
								<p>Often the biggest early gain to be made with Lean Six Sigma is also the simplest: a
									recognition that out of sight means out of mind. And it is common for the biggest
									and ripest of low-hanging fruit to be hidden from sight until each step in
									completing a task is dissected in what is called “process mapping.”</p>
								<p>Outlining the problem of long delays, CIO Kevin Divine of the Hunoval Law Firm asked
									supervisors and staff in the firm’s North Carolina default department how long they
									thought it took from file intake to sending out a notice of hearing to launch the
									foreclosure process. Anecdotally, they saw it as 14 to 20 days. But the crunched
									numbers tallied 69.</p>
								<p>“They were dumbfounded and somewhat defensive,” Divine says.</p>
								<p>He met with the department manager and the two staffers: one who handles the
									substitute trustee aspect and the other who puts together the completed
									notice-of-hearing package.</p>
								<p>They brainstormed in front of a flat screen displaying a dashboard, much like one on
									a car, except the gauges and measures concern target numbers and actual numbers for
									various stages in the process, with readouts color-coded green for good, red for bad
									and white for OK.</p>
								<p>Ultimately, a big part of the cure would be to take files out of drawers and put them
									in plain sight on desks, and eventually to have cleared desks at the end of each
									day. But that answer came only after the team went through a procedure beginning
									with an LSS fishbone diagram (above). It details causes and effects throughout the
									various steps of a work in progress.</p>
								<p>The Hunoval team mapped out the involvement of various people, machines, methods and
									measures. They analyzed each person’s actions in the process; specific involvement
									of computers (the “machines” in this case); every method, such as filing; and how
									progress is measured in the process from beginning to end.</p>
								<p>The team reviews the dashboard monthly to see whether they are getting closer to
									target dates in various areas and to address problems.</p>
								<p>Sometimes these areas, such as people and methods, can overlap; thus the realization
									that putting necessary files back in file cabinets at the end of the day and mixing
									them in with files that were not needed at the time was a problem.</p>
								<p>“They were putting the needle back in the haystack every day,” Divine says.</p>
								<p>Besides the forehead-slapping realization of forgotten files, the team found
									documents weren’t signed by attorneys in timely fashion; there was a reliance on
									paper files rather than scanning them into a database; to-do lists were set up
									improperly; and title searches remained incomplete.</p>
