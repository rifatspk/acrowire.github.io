								<p>We discussed the process of defining technical debt in a <a
										href="../technical-debt-part-1-definition.html">previous article</a> which
									outlines some important items that should be considered before going about
									identifying it within an organization. Only after a clear vision of what technical
									debt means to the organization has been established should one go about the process
									of trying to find it. Some sources of debt are going to be easier to find than
									others. Unfortunately, the most difficult sources to find sometimes present the most
									risk. The process of identifying technical debt should be evolutionary where each
									iteration of the process incorporates feedback from the previous iteration.</p>
								<p>Sometimes just looking at how a project team communicates provides clues that
									technical debt may exist. In a <a
										href="http://www.media-landscape.com/yapc/2006-06-26.AndyLester/">talk by Andy
										Lester</a>, he provides a list of signs that can indicate the existence of debt.
									If you hear a project team make any of the following statements it can be cause for
									concern.</p>
								<p>· Don’t we have documentation on the file layouts?</p>
								<p>· I thought we had a test for that!</p>
								<p>· If I change X it is going to break Y….I think.</p>
								<p>· Don’t touch that code. The last time we did it took weeks to fix.</p>
								<p>· The server is down. Where are the backups?</p>
								<p>· Where is the email about that bug?</p>
								<p>· We can’t upgrade. No one understands the code.</p>
								<p>While a lot of technical folks will get a good laugh when reading that list of
									statements, they are laughing because they’ve likely heard each of them several
									times. Each statement points to a potential source of technical debt such as
									insufficient documentation, inadequate QA processes, a code base in need of
									refactoring, the lack of a disaster recovery plan and the absence of a formal bug
									tracking system. These statements also indicate sources of interest that is being
									paid such as drains on productivity, reworking broken code, inability to migrate to
									current platforms and potentially lost data.</p>
								<p>Unfortunately it isn’t always possible to tap into team communications to look for
									suspicious language. However, it is often possible to define measures to help zero
									in on where debt may exist. These measures can be both qualitative and quantitative
									and act as leading and lagging indicators of the inevitable interest payments. These
									metrics do offer the possibility of creating technical debt KRIs (key risk
									indicators). These KRIs could then be assembled into dashboards and/or heat maps to
									highlight potential areas of concern. Let’s take a look at a few examples.</p>

								<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
								<p>As the size of the organization and breadth of the search for debt grows larger, so
									do the challenges. In larger organizations, broad initiatives that identify issues
									and implicate individuals will meet resistance. No one likes to be told that their
									group or department is not meeting expectations. Larger initiatives need to be
									championed by the senior leaders of the organization to head off pushback.
									Additionally, when technical debt is discovered it needs to be handled with care. If
									managers are punished or looked upon unfavorably it will create friction that could
									short circuit the entire process.</p>
								<p>Managers should be encouraged to self-identify technical debt and be rewarded for
									doing so by having the remediation prioritized appropriately. The carrot works
									better than the stick in these situations because there are always ways to fudge
									metrics. Having proper code coverage is only useful if effective tests are written
									to evaluate the code. If developers write ineffective tests just to keep their
									metrics green quality will suffer. If managers are rewarded with the resources
									necessary to make their teams more efficient there will be an incentive to make the
									process work. Conversely, if they are punished they will try to game the system and
									avoid the negative consequences.</p>
								<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
								<p>There are a number of potential challenges associated with identifying technical
									debt. These challenges grow exponentially if the wrong approach is used. As we
									discussed, the right approach involves an evolutionary approach to identification
									and making sure that there are incentives for getting technical debt on the
									corporate radar. There are also a number of frameworks available (e.g. COBIT, ITIL,
									PMBOK, etc) to help identify potential gaps and outline best IT practices. Making
									the management of technical debt part of the corporate culture is the key to long
									term success. Consider establishing a central repository to track it, use project
									management tools that facilitate that tracking, and creating an awareness initiative
									on why managing technical debt is in everyone’s best interest.</p>
