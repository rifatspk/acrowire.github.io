							<div class="entry-content">
								<p>To date, this blog has delivered professional posts to help educate and inform my
									peers and clients.  It&#8217;s rare that my personal life visibly crosses paths with
									my professional life, yet it&#8217;s no secret that as a business owner, both have a
									profound impact on the success of my company.  Both personal and professional
									experiences have shaped the identity of Acrowire and continue to do so.</p>
								<p>This past week, I had a very personal experience highlight what an impact we can make
									through our professional lives. My mother has an incurable lung disease called
									pulmonary fibrosis and doesn’t have much time.  She lives with my wife and I but has
									great difficulty moving and hasn’t been able to leave the confines of her room in
									months.  Simple movements that we take for granted require monumental effort and
									lung capacity.  Not only has she become too physically weak to walk, but she is
									hooked up to two oxygen concentrators that require electricity, further limiting her
									mobility and opportunities to do the things she would like.  She had accepted that
									her remaining time would be spent indoors, in bed, day in and day out.  We all had.
								</p>
								<p>During a routine visit with hospice, she casually mentioned to her nurse and social
									worker that she was a Star Wars fan and wished she would have gotten to see the
									movie before becoming bedbound.  One day later, the social worker arranged the
									unimaginable. She took it upon herself to call a local theater for a private viewing
									of Star Wars for my mother. Every detail was considered and planned for including a
									Geri Chair that was delivered to our doorstep, medical transportation to and from
									the theater, as well as 4-foot oxygen tanks.  Members of hospice who have grown
									particularly close with my family attended the movie as well to share in this
									special occasion.  The experience was something that I will literally remember for
									the rest of my life and the same can be said by my two brothers, wife and young son
									who also attended.</p>
								<p><strong>So what’s the business takeaway here?</strong> You know who will also likely
									not forget what happened today? The employees of the theater, hospice group and
									medical transportation company. It was written all over their faces. They were proud
									to work for an organization that would make it possible for a dying old lady to have
									one last wish. I have no idea what core values these businesses have defined but
									they clearly go beyond attitude, work ethic, winning, etc. that are typical in
									corporate America.</p>
								<p>As a business owner this experience has made me take a second look at my own
									company’s core values and the culture we’re trying to create. <strong>Creating an
										environment where people truly love what they do and are proud of the company
										for whom they work is vital</strong>, but not an easy task. I would argue that
									it is much more difficult than growing revenue, increasing margins, establishing
									brand recognition or any of those other conventional measures of success. Not only
									is it more difficult to create such a culture but it’s harder to directly measure
									and doesn’t show up explicitly on a firm’s financials.  A successful culture will
									impact your bottom line in big ways by improving customer/associate satisfaction and
									retention but it&#8217;s not a line item on a balance sheet or P&amp;L and
									often doesn&#8217;t get the attention it deserves.</p>
								<p>On a personal level, this experience allowed my family to have a few precious hours
									where we were able to escape the realities of the inevitable. I was able to create
									one last happy memory with one of the most important people in my life and someone
									who had everything to do with who I am as human being. Ironically, the private
									showing was mid-morning and probably didn’t cost the theater a lot of money but no
									amount of money could ever buy what they gave us. Something that cost so little
									created a bright spot in a very difficult chapter in our lives and showed employees
									of three different organizations that their company cares.</p>
								<p>The experience made a huge impact on my personal life and will forever change my
									perspective on core values and corporate culture. The return on investment on the
									dollars spent to make today possible is absolutely immeasurable. <strong>I have
										begun to ask myself this and would encourage you do the same: “What does your
										company’s core values and culture stand for?”.</strong></p>
