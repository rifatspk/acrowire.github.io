								<p>There are two key components to the technical debt equation: principal and interest. 
									Quantifying both the principal owed and the interest payments being made are
									critical.  Without a complete picture of the cost of the debt, calculating the
									return on investment (ROI) on resolving the debt is not possible.  Understanding ROI
									is necessary in order to prioritize debt remediation efforts against other pending
									initiatives.  We discussed the <a
										href="../technical-debt-part-1-definition.html">finite nature of
										technology resources (free cash flow) in Part 1</a> and why that resource has to
									be allocated carefully.  Comparing the ROI of proposed technology initiatives allows
									organizations to compare projects objectively and maximize free cash flow.</p>
								<p><strong>Principal Component</strong></p>
								<p>To illustrate, let’s say we have a legacy application that leverages outdated
									technologies.  Maintaining legacy applications can present many challenges. 
									Enhancements typically take longer because the tools used to maintain the
									application don’t take advantage of more modern development environments and
									methods.  Many legacy environments also fail take full advantage of advances in
									software engineering such as object orientation, integrated unit/regression testing,
									continuous integration and distributed source control.  This can lead to decreases
									in quality and increases in complexity, risk and development time.</p>
								<p>The amount of principal owed in this example is the cost of migrating the legacy
									application to a modern platform.  If the cost of the target platform is $100,000
									and the cost of implementation is $60,000 then the principal on this technical debt
									would equal $160,000.  Quantifying the principal owed on technical debt is usually
									just an exercise in traditional IT project estimation.  Gary Short proposed a <a
										href="http://www.slideshare.net/garyshort/technical-debt-2985889">formula</a> as
									a starting point for calculating technical debt.  The formula is a useful guide for
									calculating the costs associated with remediating technical debt but does not
									include interest expense.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p><a href="../../assets/images/Principal.png"><img
												loading="lazy" alt=""
												src="../../assets/images/Principal_thumb.png"
												width="339" height="95" border="0" /></a></p>
									<ul>
										<li>n = Number of resources required</li>
										<li>R = Rate (hourly average) of resource</li>
										<li>H = Hours required</li>
										<li>C = Costs associated with benefits, payroll, recruitment (usually ~40% of
											hourly rate)</li>
										<li>HC = Hardware Costs</li>
										<li>SL = Software Licenses</li>
										<li>MI = Migration and Implementation expenses (e.g. consulting engagements,
											training, etc)</li>
									</ul>
								</blockquote>
								<p><strong>Interest Component</strong></p>
								<p>The interest an organization is paying are the additional costs incurred as a result
									of the existence of technical debt. These additional costs are driven by a number of
									factors but most can be categorized as <strong>lost productivity</strong> and
									the <strong>exposure to increased risk</strong>.  Much of the literature available
									on technical debt focuses on the productivity losses that debt brings to the table. 
									I think the reason the literature focuses there is because it is the most visible
									and the easiest part of interest expense to quantify.  For example, if you wanted to
									get a high level estimate of the productivity losses associated with maintaining the
									legacy application you could compare how long it took to implement a feature in the
									system and compare it to how long it might take in a different environment.  Once
									again, this would consist of an exercise in project estimation.</p>
								<p><strong>The Risk Factor</strong></p>
								<p>The tricky part of calculating interest is measuring the risk the technical debt
									brings to the table.  This isn’t a challenge unique to technical debt.  Assigning a
									dollars to risk factors is difficult in just about every context.  While a deep
									discussion of risk quantification is outside the scope of this article, my hope is
									that by highlighting a few examples it will provoke additional thought and
									discussion in your organization.   The point to come away with here is that the
									increased risk associated with technical debt often has the greatest implications. 
									The costs associated with lost productivity are usually the tip of the proverbial
									iceberg when it comes to the true interest cost.</p>
								<p><a href="../../assets/images/Fotolia_6019092_XS.jpg"><img
											loading="lazy" title="The tip of the iceberg" alt="The tip of the iceberg"
											src="../../assets/images/Fotolia_6019092_XS_thumb.jpg"
											width="375" height="282" border="0" /></a></p>
								<p>Below are a few examples of risks legacy architectures often present.  These risks
									aren’t always apparent but need to be estimated and included in the interest
									calculation.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The lack of quality developers who understand the technology.  This gap will
										increase as additional time passes.</li>
									<li>Increased turnover on technical teams driven by the lack of innovation.</li>
									<li>The additional cost and security risks associated with maintaining legacy
										infrastructure to accommodate the application.</li>
									<li>The inability to upgrade related platforms because of critical integration
										points.</li>
									<li>Being potentially unable to accommodate future requirements due to architecture
										limitations.</li>
									<li>Customer service implications associated with the inability to meet changing
										demands.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>Compound Interest</strong></p>
								<p>One unfortunate fact about technical debt is that the interest usually compounds.  In
									other words, debt begets debt.  Let’s say that your team receives a request from
									your business partners to create a mobile application that interfaces with the
									legacy application.  Because the application was designed well before service
									oriented architectures (SOAs) became popular, your team has to create and maintain a
									separate application programming interface (API) to accommodate the request.</p>
								<p>Any future enhancements that require modifications to the core of the system will
									require that you make changes in the system itself and the new API that was “bolted
									on” to the application.  The existence of the original technical debt (legacy
									architecture) has created more debt (duplicated logic) and more corresponding
									interest payments (lost productivity, increased risk of defects, longer turn around
									on enhancements).  This phenomena is analogous to <a
										href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest">compounding interest</a>.
								</p>
								<p>If we determine that the interest rate we are paying on the technical debt associated
									with our legacy application is 20%, the amount we will owe grows to almost three
									times the original amount in five years.  We started with an estimated cost to
									remediate the debt of $160,000 but it will cost us approximately $430,000 to pay it
									back five years later.</p>
								<p><a href="../../assets/images/image.png"><img
											loading="lazy" title="image" alt="image"
											src="../../assets/images/image_thumb.png"
											width="548" height="381" border="0" /></a></p>
								<p>This also means that in five years, we are spending $80,000 annually just to contend
									with the shortcomings associated with our legacy application.  That’s about the cost
									of one full-time employee who is solely dedicated to servicing our debt.  Hopefully
									this article has inspired some thought on how to go about getting a handle on
									technical shortcomings in your organization!  <strong>In my next article we will
										look at some strategies for remediating your technical debt.</strong></p>
