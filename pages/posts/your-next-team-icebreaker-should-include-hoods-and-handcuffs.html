								<p>Being a small IT consulting firm, culture is one of the most important components of
									our healthy business. While some teammates reside in West Palm Beach, Orlando,
									Gainesville and Chapel Hill, the majority of us work together in Charlotte. The way
									we all work together directly translates to how well we execute on client projects.
								</p>
								<p>As a team, we must <strong>communicate</strong>. We need to raise our hand when we
									need help, address our pain points, celebrate our wins, listen carefully and ask
									questions to show our understanding.</p>
								<p>As a team, we must <strong>work hard</strong>. We are a small business and “coasting”
									is not in our blood. We work with one another to produce results and hold everyone
									accountable, yet, we rely on only ourselves for motivation.</p>
								<p>As a team, we must<strong> respect</strong> one another. We listen to other people’s
									ideas and opinions with an open mind, regardless of titles and seniority. We care
									about each other’s personal and professional growth.</p>
								<p>As a team, we must <strong>grow</strong> together. We are always changing, always
									growing and always learning. New challenges may set us back temporarily, but we
									overcome them and keep moving forward. Backwards is not an option.</p>
								<p>As a team, we must <strong>trust</strong> one another. We follow through on our
									promises and deliver quality work. We know that both our team and our clients are in
									good hands.</p>
								<p>Most importantly, as a team, we must <strong>enjoy the journey</strong>. If one of
									our teammates is not happy, the team as a whole isn’t happy. We may not always have
									great days, but we must always feel challenged, rewarded and appreciated at the end
									of the day. After all, it is our people that create our success.</p>
								<p>Working together professionally is only half the fun. Yesterday, the Acrowire team
									(minus those that work remotely or were unable to attend) left work early to grab
									dinner at Mac’s and then to Exit Strategy. Exit Strategy is an engaging and
									challenging 60-minute exercise that forces players to work together solving puzzles
									and cracking codes to &#8220;escape.&#8221; We were hooded, handcuffed and chained
									to one another in a cramped, dim room. Being led by our chained partner in front of
									us, we trusted the path we were going. We quickly adapted to this new environment
									and immediately began working together to escape. Some held lanterns while others
									tried unique lock codes. Some read instructions while others executed on them. Some
									brainstormed ideas while others acted accordingly. One by one, we were released from
									our shackles and celebrated each win together.</p>
								<p>The only way to do this was by leveraging our existing values and the unique “thing”
									that makes our culture so strong.</p>
