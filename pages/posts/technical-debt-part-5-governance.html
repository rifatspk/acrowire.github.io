								<p>Corporate governance programs have taken on a much more significant focus since the
									latest wave of high profile corporate failures. Companies with tremendous history
									and prestige like Bear Stearns, AIG, and Lehman Brothers collapsed practically
									overnight because the desire for short term performance overshadowed the need for
									prudent risk management.  There were governance and oversight processes in place
									designed to prevent this type of outcome.  However, the misguided corporate cultures
									at these organizations had much more influence on decision making.</p>
								<p>In 2004 MIT’s Center for Information Systems Research did a global study (CISR
									Working Paper No. 349) that found that companies with effective IT governance are
									20% more profitable.  The study concluded that the single best indicator of
									effective IT governance is awareness of governance processes.  On average, only 38%
									of senior managers understand how technology is governed compared to 60-80% of
									senior managers at top performing firms.  The gap between the top performing firms
									and the average company is driven by ineffective risk management cultures.  It isn’t
									difficult to make a business case for addressing this gap with one fifth of a
									company’s overall profitability at stake.  Below is an excerpt from the first
									paragraph of the MIT study.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>Companies with effective IT governance have <strong>profits that are 20% higher
											than other companies</strong>pursuing similar strategies.  One viable
										explanation for this differential is that IT governance specifies
										accountabilities for IT-related business outcomes and <strong>helps
											companies</strong> <strong>align their IT investments with their business
											priorities</strong>…Ignorance is not bliss.  In our research, senior
										management awareness of IT governance processes proved to be the <strong>single
											best indicator</strong> of governance effectiveness…Taking the time at
										senior management levels to design, implement, and communicate IT governance
										processes is worth the trouble – <strong>it pays off</strong>.</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>Many organizations think of governance as a collection of committees, policies, and
									enforcement mechanisms.  These are important components but are largely ineffective
									without the appropriate culture to support them (Grant 12).  Organizations must
									establish corporate cultures that promote equal focus to both sides of the
									risk/reward equation.  <a
										href="http://www.towersperrin.com/tp/showhtml.jsp?url=global/service-areas/enterprise-risk-management/rapid-risk-assessment/index.htm">Towers
										Watson defines the six key drivers</a> of risk management culture within
									organizations as follows.</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Communication</li>
									<li>Leadership Commitment</li>
									<li>Teamwork and Collaboration</li>
									<li>Resourcing</li>
									<li>Rewarding Behaviors</li>
									<li>Risk Controls</li>
								</ol>
								<p>Driving an effective risk management culture clearly goes well beyond drafting
									policies and enforcing compliance.  Implementing policies and procedures without
									addressing corporate culture won’t be any more effective than the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
									(SOX) was at preventing the financial crisis.</p>
								<p><strong>P/PC Balance</strong></p>
								<p>In his best seller, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Dr. Stephen Covey
									discusses the importance of maintaining the balance of production with production
									capability.  He calls this maintaining P/PC balance.  Covey points out that it is
									not enough to be productive; <strong>we must constantly sharpen the tools we
										use </strong>to achieve greater productivity.  In technology, we can think of
									production as the creation and maintenance of features needed to support our
									operating environment and production capability as our ability to create and
									maintain these features.  If we focus all of our resources on implementing new
									features, technical debt increases and our ability to create new features
									diminishes.  <strong>Effectiveness lies in the balance</strong> of production of
									desired results, and the production capability to achieve those results.</p>
								<p><strong>Capital Structure</strong></p>
								<p>So how do organizations decide what levels of technical debt are acceptable? 
									Unfortunately, there is no magic threshold that applies universally.  It is a
									similar question that CFOs face when determining the best capital structure for
									their business.  Deciding the right amount of debt and equity capital is dependent
									upon a number of factors specific to the business.  This includes the cost of
									capital, projected free cash flow, volatility and risk tolerance.  CIOs must
									evaluate a similar set of considerations when determining appropriate levels of
									technical debt.  While the capital structure metaphor isn’t perfect, there are many
									useful parallels to help us think through the problem of determining appropriate
									debt levels.</p>
								<p>If we think of technical debt as <strong>debt capital</strong>, and portions of the
									technology infrastructure not affected by technical debt as <strong>equity
										capital</strong>, we must determine the appropriate debt to equity (D/E) ratio
									to maintain a healthy <strong>balance sheet</strong>.  In <a
										href="http://blog.acrowire.com/technical-debt/technical-debt-part-1-definition/">Part
										1</a> we defined <strong>free cash flow</strong> as the amount of resources
									available to maintain and enhance systems.  The challenge with debt capital is that
									interest payments must be made to service that debt.  Therefore, if there are
									fluctuations in your free cash flow (available resources) that could interfere with
									your ability to make interest payments and lead to insolvency and eventually
									towards <strong>technical bankruptcy</strong>.  Additionally, if your operating
									environment is volatile (i.e. subject to frequent change), the interest rates on
									your debt will fluctuate accordingly.</p>
								<p><strong>Centralized Management</strong></p>
								<p>Managing technical debt in a centralized way is an important factor in ensuring
									consistency.  If departments are left to their own devices to track, measure and
									remediate their technical debt it will become difficult to maintain a consistent
									enterprise level view of the balance sheet.  Organizations would be wise to consider
									a <strong>centralized registration database</strong> to track technical debt.  This
									database should also be managed by an objective independent party outside the line
									of business and technology departments.  Business and technology partners will
									likely have conflicting perspectives that will have to be reconciled.  In many cases
									technology partners will tend to <strong>sharpen the saw</strong> too much and
									business partners sometimes won’t want to sharpen it enough.</p>
								<p>There are methods to help reconcile differing perspectives on the amount of resources
									that should be allocated to paying back technical debt.  One approach might be to
									assign a value to each line of inadequate code and <strong>establish a credit limit
										for an application</strong> that is agreed to by the stakeholders in advance. 
									When the application exceeds its <strong>credit limit</strong>, new features get put
									on hold while refactoring takes place.  If an Agile methodology is being leveraged,
									it could be mandated that every Xth sprint be dedicated to refactoring.</p>
								<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
								<p>Unfortunately, there are no silver bullets in the war against technical debt.  As
									we’ve seen from this series on technical debt, however, there are strategies for
									tackling the problem.  The key to formulating an effective strategy on managing the
									technical debt lifecycle can be summarized by the these key points.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Define, measure and manage technical debt consistently</li>
									<li>Not all technical debt is bad</li>
									<li>Know what warning signs look like</li>
									<li>New debt is unavoidable</li>
									<li>Create a culture of transparency</li>
									<li>Be proactive in managing technical debt</li>
								</ul>
								<p>If your organization needs help getting a handle on technical debt, feel free to
									reach out to us for assistance.  Thanks for taking the time to read my thoughts on
									the subject.  I look forward to your feedback.</p>
