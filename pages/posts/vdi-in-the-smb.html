								<p>Until recently, VDI was a technology reserved for enterprise level customers with
									deep pockets and an equally deep roster of expert IT staff to support it.  The
									expense and complexity of VDI implementations has historically kept SMBs from even
									considering the technology.  When the Citrix VDI-in-a-Box (ViaB) product debuted it
									changed the landscape dramatically by making the platform cheap and simple to
									implement.  By allowing the use of inexpensive commodity hardware and building in
									resiliency at a low cost, ViaB creates a real business case for VDI for SMBs.</p>
								<h3><strong>Reduced Management and Support</strong></h3>
								<p>The savings in management and support time that VDI brings to the table is hard to
									over emphasize. Because ViaB allows you to create standard desktop images based on
									department (e.g. accounting, sales, etc), provisioning new desktops with all
									required applications takes literally seconds. Therefore, new hires have a working
									environment immediately instead of waiting for staff to install the required
									applications and configure the operating system.</p>
								<p>Additionally, if a new application needs to be rolled out to users it is as simple as
									updating the master image and setting the desktops to refresh after the next logout.
									You never have to worry that an app won’t install on a workstation because it’s not
									running the latest service pack or is 64 bit instead of 32 bit because of the
									standardized nature of VDI. <strong>This model also reduces support costs
										significantly</strong> because if someone is having trouble with their desktop,
									it can be blown away and a new desktop provisioned. With roaming profiles, the user
									will hardly notice the change and all data should be preserved.  Choosing between
									persistent and dynamic desktops is a subject in another post.</p>
								<h3><strong>Information Security</strong></h3>
								<p>When users lose laptops in the business world it can be a real problem. If sensitive
									customer or company data resides on the lost hardware it puts everyone involved at
									risk. Embarrassing disclosures to customers must be made which erodes confidence and
									damages a company’s brand. With a properly configured VDI
									environment, <strong>sensitive data never resides on laptops, iPads or any other
										endpoint</strong>. The information does not leave the confines of the
									well-controlled server environment.</p>
								<p>Even if a company goes through the expense of ensuring that every laptop issued is
									encrypted, there is still significant risk of data loss. For example, it is very
									difficult to prevent users from copying data to a thumb drive, transferring data to
									their home network or simply emailing data to unauthorized locations while on
									external internet connections. ViaB allows companies to completely lock down the
									desktops and prevent every scenario described with modest effort.</p>
								<h3><strong>Hardware Related Savings</strong></h3>
								<p>Because everything runs on the server, extremely small and inexpensive terminals can
									be used instead of costly workstations. These terminals cost as little as $200 and
									are not much bigger than a deck of playing cards making them very cost and space
									efficient. Compare that to buying bulky $800 workstations every time and it’s not
									hard to see how quickly VDI could pay for itself. In addition to being inexpensive,
									these devices are extremely energy efficient. They consume very little energy,
									produce almost no heat and make no noise as they have no moving parts. If there are
									legacy workstations laying around they can likely be used as endpoints also.</p>
								<p>Another way to quickly realize savings is by implementing a <a
										href="http://gigaom.com/2012/04/08/byod-is-unstoppable-smart-companies-must-build-apps/"
										target="_blank">bring your own device (BYOD) policy</a>. These days many users
									already have laptops and tablets that they are comfortable and productive with.
									Forcing users to use clunky company issued laptops when they may already have a
									lightweight MacBook Air doesn’t make much sense. <strong>Users can travel with just
										their personal laptop and still have complete access to their corporate
										desktop</strong> instead of lugging around two computers.</p>
								<h3><strong>Improved Productivity</strong></h3>
								<p>Users are more productive because they can access their desktops from anywhere
									there’s an Internet connection. If they wake up not feeling well and decide to work
									from home, they simply login to their desktop from their home computer. This will
									keep the rest of your staff healthy and allow sick employees to rest in the comfort
									of their own home and recover quickly. Workers typically appreciate this
									flexibility, which increases employee satisfaction and retention.</p>
								<p>Because rolling out new operating systems is expensive and time consuming, many
									companies let workers deal with the inefficiencies of older software. ViaB makes
									rolling out new operating systems and applications a breeze which keeps workers
									productive. A side benefit of having everyone on a standard operating system and
									application suite is the elimination of compatibility issues. You don’t have to
									worry that someone who created a diagram in Visio 2010 will send it to someone with
									Visio 2003 and can’t open it. These incompatibilities also increase unnecessary
									support calls and cause general frustration. For these reasons, getting users on a
									standard image improves productivity significantly.</p>
								<h3><strong>Next Steps</strong></h3>
								<p>I have included a short video from Citrix discussing some of the benefits of VDI and
									encourage you to post questions or comments about anything I’ve touched on.  If you
									have questions specific to your environment, please reach out to us directly. <a
