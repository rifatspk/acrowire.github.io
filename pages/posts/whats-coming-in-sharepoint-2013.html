								<p>It is sometimes difficult to justify coming up for air and taking the time to
									evaluate products that are still very much in motion.  In the case of SharePoint
									2013, however, it wasn’t hard at all.  Acrowire has recognized the value SharePoint
									brings to the table for a very long time, but we decided to put serious resources
									into our practice when Office 365 released in Summer of 2011.  Prior to that point
									SharePoint Online was too limited to build robust solutions on the platform.  With
									Office 365’s roll out of SharePoint 2010 that picture began to change.</p>
								<p>There were (and still are) quite a few limitations to what you can do with SharePoint
									Online compared to on-prem but that gap continues to narrow.  We believe the gap
									will narrow even further as the 2013 feature set is integrated to SharePoint
									Online.  Below are some notes from our analysis of the new platform.</p>
								<h3><strong>eDiscovery</strong></h3>
								<p>In eDiscovery, SharePoint maintains cases, which for example are lawsuits or
									potential legal actions. These cases are organized into collections, for example
									collections by year, by division, or even by persons or groups.</p>
								<p>Each case has one or more discovery sources, which are either mail boxes or web
									sites. Each such source is assigned to a custodian, a person associated with the
									source.</p>
								<p>The case also has a set of searches that are applied to the sources to find relevant
									information. These searches and their queries will go through the sources and
									discover information that can be added to the case.</p>
								<h3><strong>Client Object Model Extensions</strong></h3>
								<p>The Client Object Model (COM) gets a major overhaul in SharePoint 2013.  Some notable
									areas are a) SharePoint Education (see more below), b) Publishing Framework, c) BCS
									and d) Search.</p>
								<h3><strong>SharePoint App Market Place</strong></h3>
								<p>SharePoint Apps will support multi-tenancy. It appears that Apps will support both
									sandboxed and farm solutions.</p>
								<h3><strong>Work Management Services</strong></h3>
								<p>Work management services handle tasks assigned to users. From my cursory
									understanding at this point work management services provide extended capabilities
									for managing, creating, reordering, deleting, and creating tasks, as well as
									synchronizing tasks with other platforms (at least Exchange is documented).</p>
								<h3><strong>Content Management Service</strong></h3>
								<p>The Publishing service lives on – now under the Content Management service, along
									with features such as managed metadata, document transformations, and the
									aforementioned eDiscovery.</p>
								<h3><strong>Minimal Download Framework</strong></h3>
								<p>Briefly what the MDS does is that it allows users to load only what changes between
									pages. This drastically reduces page load time and speeds up responsiveness for the
									entire application.</p>
								<h3><strong>Javascript Rendering of Forms</strong></h3>
								<p>New here is the addition of a JSLink attribute on SharePoint 2013 forms. According to
									the documentation, the JSLink attribute specifies the script used in rendering the
									form. JSLink may prove to be an easier way to add scripts to a form rather than
									having to resort to jQuery making client side customizations easier</p>
								<h3><strong>SharePoint Education</strong></h3>
								<p>SharePoint Education aims at satisfying educational institutions’ needs for a
									collaborative and educational environment. It seems to target the needs of both
									faculty and students, and supports features such as:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>academic documents, likely books, articles, and so on</li>
									<li>communities, a new grouping mechanism, ‘parent’ of courses</li>
									<li>courses, a collection of academic documents, assignments, and lessons</li>
									<li>assignments, including assigning assignments to individual students</li>
									<li>events, possibly real-time lectures and assignment deadlines</li>
									<li>meetings, including recording of online meetings and meeting schedules</li>
									<li>grades, numeric or non-numeric (letter)</li>
									<li>quizzes</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Despite having a distinct academic feel to it, SharePoint Education should be usable
									for organizational training too. Because of the ease of extensibility, and because
									SharePoint Education uses only ‘plain’ SharePoint objects, it should be easy to
									either modify the product to organizations’ needs, or build extensions to cover
									anything that doesn’t come out-of-the-box.</p>
								<h3><strong>SharePoint 2013 Beta</strong></h3>
								<p>Looks like the public beta will arrive the beginning of July 2012.</p>
								<h3><strong>ASP.NET Version</strong></h3>
								<p>Because the ASP.NET 2.0 and ASP.NET 4.0 aren’t interchangeable, code written to run
									in SharePoint 2007 and SharePoint 2010 won’t work for SharePoint 2013 if Microsoft
									decides to go with ASP.NET 4.0 for the new version….</p>
								<p>Update – Looks like it will be ASP.NET 4.0 – Now because SharePoint 2013 requires
									.NET 4.0, and .NET 2.0 won’t run .NET 4.0 code, this means that any code written to
									interact with SharePoint 2013 will not work on previous versions. This means that
									developers who want to support both current and future versions of SharePoint will
									need to maintain two sets of code.</p>
								<h3><strong>Push Notifications</strong></h3>
								<p>SharePoint 2013 will support Push notifications for clients such as mobile phones.
									These clients will register with SharePoint and then subscribe to notifications from
									the server. Subscriptions for Push notifications are scoped to individual sites
									(web).</p>
								<h3><strong>Sharing</strong></h3>
								<p>A new web service for document sharing, aptly named Document Sharing Web Service
									(DOCSWS) appears in the document management features of SharePoint 2013. Document
									owners can now choose to generate anonymous links for a document in a document
									library. These links can be used by anonymous users to either read or edit the
									document, depending on the permissions that the document owner sets.</p>
								<h3><strong>Final RTM</strong></h3>
								<p>SharePoint 15 should arrive in early 2013 along with Office 15 and most of the
									related products and servers, like Exchange, Lync, Project, and so on.</p>
								<h3><strong>SharePoint Online 2013</strong></h3>
								<p>Here are some of the features likely to be part of the release:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>SharePoint Duet: A cloud version of the Duet add-on developed by Microsoft and
										Microsoft that allows SharePoint to integrate with SAP applications</li>
									<li>Support for viewing business intelligence content on Apple iPad devices</li>
									<li>Improved Web Apps:  With the 15 release, Office Web Apps won’t be running from
										the SharePoint “farm.” Instead the Webified versions of Microsoft’s Office apps
										will run from a new Office Web Apps Server. Third party developers will be able
										to tie into the Office Web Apps service and provide access to documents stored
										in IBM FileNet, OpenText, and Oracle</li>
									<li>Metro user interface: Tiles in site collections will display more information
										when you hover your mouse over them, in a Metro-like style</li>
									<li>Rights Management Services (RMS): RMS is being integrated into SharePoint Server
										12 (and Exchange Server 15). Sounds like the same is happening with the cloud
										versions of these products. It seems RMS on the cloud side also might be
										available as an add-in or separate SKU</li>
									<li>Project Online: New Project site to manage lightweight projects.</li>
									<li>It also sounds as though there will be a Visio cloud service component, too.
									</li>
									<li>Supposedly there will also be a heavy dependence on Azure too.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3><strong>Metro Interface</strong></h3>
								<p>SharePoint 2013 will have a Metro user interface. What this means is highly
									uncertain, but it seems reasonable that Microsoft will want to keep a single theme
									to their user interfaces.</p>
								<h3><strong>iPad Support</strong></h3>
								<p>SharePoint Online users with iPads will get an added ability to view business
									intelligence content. It’s not clear what this entails beyond the regular ability to
									read web content on the iPad, though.</p>
