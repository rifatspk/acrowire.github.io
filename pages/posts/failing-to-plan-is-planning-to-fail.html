								<p>There has been quite a bit of press coverage regarding the  outage at Amazon this
									week.  Much of this coverage has focused on how the outage has brought down many
									popular web sites such as Reddit, Quora and Foursquare.  The point that seems to be
									getting missed here is that by failing to plan, these companies planned to fail. 
									Technology professionals know that data centers fail all the time.  <strong>Data
										center failures are a fact of life that must be planned for and dealt
										with</strong>.  While it’s true that Amazon did not live up to expectations,
									they actually did not violate their service level agreement (SLA) as <a
										href="http://blogs.gartner.com/lydia_leong/2011/04/21/amazon-outage-and-the-auto-immune-vulnerabilities-of-resiliency/"
										target="_blank">Gartner pointed out</a>.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>Amazon’s SLA for EC2 is 99.95% for multi-AZ deployments. That means that you
										should expect that you can have about 4.5 hours of total region downtime each
										year without Amazon violating their SLA. Note, by the way, that this outage does
										not actually violate their SLA. Their SLA defines unavailability as a lack of
										external connectivity to EC2 instances, coupled with the inability to provision
										working instances. In this case, EC2 was just fine by that definition. It was
										EBS and RDS which weren’t, and neither of those services have SLAs.</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>Amazon is an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provider which means they provide the
									hardware and low level software used to support Cloud based applications.  The
									beauty of the IaaS model is that <strong>you can design and build an application
										anyway you see fit </strong>based on your individual requirements.  If your
									application requires high availability and you choose not to address that
									requirement in your design, then you have introduced risk into your
									environment.  <strong>We call this design shortcoming “technical debt</strong>.”  I
									have blogged extensively on the subject which can be referenced if additional
									background is needed.</p>
								<p>The principal amount of this technical debt is the cost of implementing the required
									redundancy.  The interest is the cost of the additional risk associated with not
									having appropriate levels of redundancy.  There are several ways to assign dollars
									to risk but none of them are perfect.  The most straightforward approach is
									to<strong>estimate the cost of a failure and then multiply by the probability it
										will occur</strong>.  Let’s say Foursquare estimates that the cost of their
									website going down for 24 hours is one million dollars.  Based on the optimal design
									and implementation of the application, the probability of such an outage is 0.5
									percent a year.  However, because Foursquare took some design shortcuts the
									probability increased to 4 percent a year.  The interest on this technical debt can
									be calculated as follows.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<div>
										<table width="273" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" align="center">
											<tbody>
												<tr>
													<td valign="top" width="145">Incremental Risk:</td>
													<td valign="top" width="126">4%-0.5% = <strong>3.5%</strong></td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td valign="top" width="145">Cost of Failure:</td>
													<td valign="top" width="126">$1,000,000</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td valign="top" width="145">Interest:</td>
													<td valign="top" width="126"><strong>$35,000</strong></td>
												</tr>
											</tbody>
										</table>
									</div>
								</blockquote>
								<div>Should Foursquare have implemented the redundancy needed to achieve required
									uptime?  <strong>The answer depends on the principal of the debt</strong>.  If the
									cost of providing redundancy is $5,000 then it would be a very easy decision.  If
									you invest $5,000 and eliminate $35,000 of risk you’re achieving an ROI of 700%.  It
									would be a different story if the redundancy cost is $100,000.  That would provide
									an ROI of 35% which might not be a good investment.  Not many investors would sign
									up to get back 35 cents for every dollar they invest.</div>
								<p>The fact is that Cloud redundancy is cheap and Foursquare would have achieved an
									astronomical ROI by implementing it.  The culprit in this outage is not the Cloud. 
									It is technical debt.  <strong>Blaming the Cloud for these outages would be like
										blaming your hard drive manufacturer for lost data when it fails</strong>. 
									Everyone knows hard drives fail and you should always have a backup.  If your hard
									drive happened to be backed up by one of the many tools that leverage Amazon’s S3
									service that’s not technical debt.  That’s just bad luck!</p>
