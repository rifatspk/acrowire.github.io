								<p>With the rapid pace at which technology continues to evolve, maintaining a solid
									understanding of each new feature can be a challenge. New technologies mean
									different things to firms of varying sizes; just because it works for one, doesn’t
									mean it will work for all. Keeping up with the latest and greatest — and
									understanding what’s most relevant to your firm — can be extremely time-consuming.
									To save you some of that effort, let’s walk through one of the year’s hottest
									releases: Microsoft’s SharePoint 2013 platform.</p>
								<h3>A New Level of Search</h3>
								<p>SharePoint 2013 hosts a variety of new features that provide significant value to the
									legal profession. New capabilities in the way we organize, share, discover, build
									and manage content have been developed. While not every new feature is perfect, this
									release will add significant value to the overall user experience for most firms.
									Without a doubt, the improvements to search and the new collaboration tools are the
									most impressive enhancements to SharePoint 2013 in a legal context.<br />
									“Intent-driven search” was a term popularized by Yahoo in the early 2000s as a way
									to provide users a method of focusing their search results without the complexity of
									an advanced search interface. SharePoint 2013 has adopted this approach and now
									offers a much more robust platform for searching internal and external content.
									Additional improved search features include:</p>
								<p><strong>Analytics:</strong> Analytics are now a part of SharePoint 2013, having a
									direct impact on a user’s search results. These integrated analytics create more
									relevant search results as the platform learns user intent based on prior search
									behavior. Search is now a fully customizable experience providing suggestions for
									related documents, sites and even people that the user might also want to follow.
								</p>
								<p><strong>FAST Integration:</strong> In 2008, Microsoft acquired the company behind
									FAST Enterprise Search and offered the technology as an add-on to SharePoint 2010.
									FAST provides search capabilities to a wide variety of sources such as websites,
									file shares, Exchange folders, Lotus Notes, etc. The technology underlying FAST has
									been seamlessly integrated into SharePoint 2013, bringing new search capabilities to
									the end user. Unlike SharePoint 2010, this technology comes at no additional cost.
								</p>
								<p><strong>User Experience:</strong> The search user experience has been enhanced with:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Hover panels, which enable users to preview content directly from the browser
									</li>
									<li>Interactive search refiners, making it possible to hone in on a specific piece
										of content by refining the search by author, document format, time period, etc.
									</li>
									<li>Counters, showing the number of times a document has been viewed within search
										results</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>Query Rules:</strong> In the past, keywords and “Best Bets” were used to
									refine search results. In SharePoint 2013, query rules are used to create promoted
									results. Promoted results allow search administrators and site owners to set rules
									upfront correlating specific keywords to relevant results. For example, if an
									attorney were searching for a nondisclosure agreement (NDA), the site owner could
									set a query rule to promote the NDA template because that document would have the
									highest likelihood of being the most relevant. Users can also reconnect with prior
									search history quickly, as past queries are remembered and recalled as query
									suggestions.</p>
								<p><strong>Continuous Crawl:</strong> In addition to full- and incremental-crawl
									strategies, SharePoint 2013 adds a third crawl mechanism into the mix: continuous
									crawl. In a continuous crawl scenario, indexing content becomes a multithreaded
									process, improving search performance. Multiple continuous crawls can occur
									simultaneously, maintaining the most up-to-date content. This new feature runs every
									15 minutes, but the time interval can be changed as needed.</p>
								<p>Similar to earlier versions, content connectors allow content to be crawled from
									various sources. This functionality further supports powerful enterprise content
									management (ECM) opportunities. With a less-than-stellar user experience in
									SharePoint 2010 and an equally lukewarm adoption, it is no surprise Microsoft spent
									considerable resources overhauling its search capabilities. Search in SharePoint
									2013 is now a serious contender among enterprise search solutions.</p>
								<p>￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼SharePoint 2013 provides a better search experience
									with:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>&#8220;Intent-driven&#8221; results and suggestions</li>
									<li>Rich query languages, such as KQL and FQL</li>
									<li>Promoted results</li>
									<li>Saved searches</li>
									<li>Continuous crawl</li>
									<li>Tracked number of views</li>
									<li>&#8220;Follow&#8221; capabilities</li>
									<li>Visual refiners</li>
									<li>Visual displays</li>
								</ul>
								<h2>Collaborate with the click of a button</h2>
								<p>Collaboration is where SharePoint really excels, so further improvement in this area
									will continue to help law firms be more productive. Whether you want to share a
									single document or an entire site, you can do so quickly by clicking the “Share”
									button and populating the “recipient” field with the appropriate email addresses.
									You’ll also have the ability to drag and drop documents without having to open the
									SharePoint library, and these capabilities are also supported on mobile devices.
									Permissions remain secure with only the site administrator granting site access, but
									now anyone can have the authority to invite new users if needed.</p>
								<h3>Better intranet and extranet capabilities</h3>
								<p>Intranet and extranet capabilities also get an upgrade. While the overall design is
									flat, extensive branding capabilities are available with basic skills such as HTML5,
									CSS and JavaScript. Intranet and extranet sites can be fully customized, making it
									easier for smaller firms with limited IT resources to implement a fully branded
									experience. With the introduction of Device Channels, this experience is now
									compatible with mobile devices, adapting to the on-the-go mentality and culture of
									the legal profession. With enhanced out-of-the-box apps, firms can now customize
									their intranet portal to:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Build a company newsfeed</li>
									<li>Collect feedback</li>
									<li>Create communities</li>
									<li>Announce milestones and birthdays</li>
									<li>Distribute firm calendars</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>New ways to create and visualize workflows</h3>
								<p>Creating and managing workflows will be a major improvement for both developers and
									end users with Workflow Manager. Workflows are now based around ASPX pages rather
									than InfoPath forms, although InfoPath and the SharePoint 2010 workflow engine
									remain supported. In addition, the workflow engine is now separated from SharePoint
									and runs as a separate service. New workflow features include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Visual designer</li>
									<li>Stages, which reduce complexities by grouping</li>
									<li>logical sections</li>
									<li>Copy and paste functionalities</li>
									<li>Increased scalability</li>
									<li>Looping (until a specific criterion has been met)</li>
								</ul>
								<p>￼￼￼￼￼</p>
								<h4>Smarter and faster</h4>
								<p>Minimal Download Strategy (MDS) significantly improves overall SharePoint 2013
									performance by only rendering new changes when moving from page to page, resulting
									in less bandwidth use and faster page loading times.</p>
								<h3>Chat and edit simultaneously</h3>
								<p>While SharePoint isn’t always the best document management system for high-volume law
									firms, you might still find value in its collaborative editing capabilities. With
									SharePoint 2013, users will be able to co-author documents simultaneously, while
									also chatting in real time.</p>
								<h3>Worth noting, but not worth upgrading for</h3>
								<p><strong>Social:</strong> New social functionality provides users with the ability to:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Communicate and share with teammates instantly</li>
									<li>“Like” and “Follow” statuses and discussion boards</li>
									<li>Create relevancy with @ mentions and hashtags</li>
									<li>Follow microblogs</li>
									<li>Collaborate within dedicated team sites</li>
								</ul>
								<p>With a sound strategy, an enterprise social network (ESN) can add value to your firm,
									making social a potential game changer. Without a well-thought-out strategy in
									place, it might just end up as a disruption.</p>
								<p><strong>Business Intelligence (BI):</strong> With Power View, SharePoint’s newest BI
									tool, users can visually interact with data that’s been aggregated from multiple
									sources. Reports can be customized and published quickly within Excel. Data are
									interconnected among charts, maps and graphs, creating a unique BI experience.</p>
								<p><strong>Cloud:</strong> In addition to deploying SharePoint on-premise, there are a
									number of options for leveraging the platform in the cloud. Microsoft’s Office 365
									platform provides a multitenant environment, including email and communication
									options. For organizations looking to reduce IT spending and complexities, this
									might be of interest. The Microsoft Azure service allows organizations to deploy and
									manage dedicated virtual machines and configure a SharePoint farm within Microsoft’s
									data centers.</p>
								<p><strong>E-Discovery:</strong> The new E-Discovery Center allows users to perform a
									two-step approach:</p>
								<p>Identify and Hold, and Search and Explore in a central location. While many non-legal
									enterprises might find this a valuable asset to their legal, compliance and audit
									teams, legal-specific e-discovery platforms are more likely to fit your needs.</p>
								<h3>Should you upgrade?</h3>
								<p>Not all firms are created equal, and not all features within SharePoint 2013 are
									equally relevant. This makes the decision to upgrade a business decision that only
									your team can make. Start the process by answering these questions:</p>
								<p>1. Are you currently running SharePoint 2010? If you’re already running SharePoint
									2010, upgrading to SharePoint 2013 is a good option. Anyone who has gone through a
									SharePoint upgrade can tell you it can be challenging. However, if your SharePoint
									2010 environment is customized with mostly out-of- the-box features, there is a good
									chance of upgrading without a major incident.</p>
								<p>2. Do you have a good understanding of what SharePoint 2013 can do for your firm?
									Before committing to SharePoint 2013, make sure you understand how the new
									functionality will add value to your firm. If there is value to be derived,
									allocating resources to the migration might make financial sense. Try to gauge the
									magnitude of the expected migration effort before jumping in.</p>
								<p>3. Do you have adequate IT resources available to implement the migration? Migrating
									to SharePoint 2013, regardless of which version you are currently running, requires
									adequate IT resources. If you are going to upgrade, make sure you have the resources
									and budget necessary to do it properly.</p>
								<p>4. Are you currently using antiquated search technology?<br />
									If so, upgrading to SharePoint 2013 should be a serious consideration. The vast
									improvements in search could be a game changer in your firm.</p>
								<p>5. Would you consider technology an important part of your firm’s vision? Microsoft
									has put significant resources behind SharePoint innovation. Upgrading to SharePoint
									2013 can give your firm an edge in optimizing your business operations.</p>
								<p>6. Can SharePoint 2013 solve a specific problem you are having? Identify your need
									for SharePoint 2013. If there is a specific gap in your current technical
									environment that SharePoint 2013 can fill, you’ll want to evaluate an upgrade with
									your technology partners.</p>
								<p>If you answered “yes” to the majority of these questions, upgrading to SharePoint
									2013 is likely to be worth your firm’s resources. Take the time to weigh your
									options and consult with your IT partners on the best approach for moving forward.
