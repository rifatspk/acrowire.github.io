								<p>Acrowire President Ted Theodoropoulos gives expert advice for businesses choosing
									between on-premises and cloud SharePoint.<span id="more-1447"></span></p>
								<p>Ted Theodoropoulos launched Acrowire LLC as a boutique app-development consulting
									firm. These days, Acrowire has found a healthy business in helping customers develop
									apps that can run on Microsoft Office 365, which offers SharePoint hosting
									capabilities. Redmond spoke with Theodoropoulos about moving from on-premises
									SharePoint to a cloud provider.</p>
								<p><strong>In what cases are users better off doing SharePoint on-premises versus in the
										cloud?</strong><br />
									Letting a third-party vendor who specializes in SharePoint host and manage your
									environment can make a lot of sense. Most network administrators have the basic
									skills to get SharePoint up and running, but usually don&#8217;t have the requisite
									depth to get the most out of the platform. SharePoint touches many other areas of
									infrastructure &#8212; including Exchange, Active Directory, SQL Server and more
									&#8212; and has specific integration requirements. Unless the environment is
									deployed by trained SharePoint administrators, we find that best practices are often
									missed and the environment underperforms as a result. Dedicated vendors rarely make
									these basic mistakes, which improves user experience and allows the business to
									derive the most return on their SharePoint investment. We also find that
									organizations that don&#8217;t have specialized resources managing their environment
									are more likely to be one or two versions back. We&#8217;ve even seen companies run
									on completely unsupported versions of the platform because of insufficient resources
									to move to a current version. Migrating to a hosted environment can alleviate these
									issues.</p>
								<p>While migrating to a hosted environment can drastically improve an
									organization&#8217;s SharePoint return on investment, there are factors that need to
									be considered. Certain industries, for example, have regulatory requirements that
									make storing certain data in multitenant environments problematic. Cloud-based
									SharePoint deployments are also dependent upon the organization&#8217;s Internet
									connectivity; if connectivity is down or degraded, users may be unable to access
									resources. Another consideration involves integration with resources behind the
									firewall: While environments like Office 365 support integration with on-premises
									line-of-business data and Active Directory, there&#8217;s additional complexity
									involved. The added complexity isn&#8217;t excessive, but organizations would be
									wise to engage an experienced partner to guide the process.</p>
								<p>Typically, the overall level of environmental cost and complexity goes down because
									the administration and cost savings far exceed integration challenges in most
									scenarios. Taking into account the ability to scale up and down at will and the
									related software savings, cloud-based SharePoint deployments often become extremely
									attractive. For example, Office 365 offers Exchange, SharePoint and Lync for as low
									as $8 per user, which is a fraction of the cost of deploying these products
									on-premises.</p>
								<p><strong>SharePoint is all about collaboration, document sharing and social media, so
										is it better positioned for the cloud than other apps?</strong><br />
									SharePoint is all about collaboration, and any time you remove barriers to
									collaborative tools you facilitate processes. Putting SharePoint in the cloud
									eliminates the need for external vendors and customers to have VPN access and domain
									credentials, which in turn reduces risk and broadens engagement. The cloud also
									enables access to SharePoint resources to remote employees via mobile devices
									without VPN connectivity. SharePoint provides the ability to render mobile views of
									Web pages out-of-the-box, which offers limited value when those resources are locked
									up behind a firewall.</p>
								<p>The next release of the platform, currently known as SharePoint 2013, contains
									significant social and collaboration enhancements. SharePoint 2013 introduces a
									document-sharing protocol that allows users to send anonymous links to documents to
									external partners for edit and review. Jared Spataro, who&#8217;s a SharePoint
									product manager at Microsoft, was recently quoted as saying: &#8220;The first 10
									years of SharePoint were about connecting employees. The next 10 will be about
									crossing organizational boundaries.&#8221; This implies that collaboration with
									third parties will be easier but will require organizations to implement a
									public-facing SharePoint environment. Standing up SharePoint in the cloud is a great
									way to accomplish that.</p>
								<p><strong>What are the economics of SharePoint in the cloud?</strong><br />
									Hosted SharePoint deployments provide economies of scale that are out of reach for
									private organizations. It&#8217;s not practical for an enterprise to develop an
									internal SharePoint practice with scale and depth to match that of vendors whose
									business revolves around the product. In certain scenarios, it&#8217;s not
									impractical &#8212; it&#8217;s impossible. In the case of Office 365, for example,
									SharePoint Online is managed by the same company that built the product. As a
									result, Microsoft can offer the best-possible service because of its product
									expertise, and it can do so at the best price because it doesn&#8217;t have to pay
									licensing fees. Therefore, in many cases, it makes good economic sense to take a
									serious look at SharePoint Online.</p>
								<p>In addition to the economies of scale, SharePoint in the cloud provides the
									opportunity to replace capital expenditures with operating expense. When standing up
									an on-premises SharePoint environment, there&#8217;s a lot of capital expense:
									servers, SANs, routers, switches, OSes, SharePoint, SQL Server licenses and more.
									All this expense requires financing, increases tax liability, bloats balance sheets
									and decreases agility. However, multitenant deployments require a simple low monthly
									fee, require little or no up-front investment, and can scale up or down without
									penalty or delay.</p>
								<p><strong>Many shops use SharePoint tactically. In fact, SharePoint instances often
										spring up without IT or corporate knowledge. How does the cloud support this?
										How does the cloud bring discipline to this?</strong><br />
									Both the cloud and SharePoint give business users the ability to provision resources
									on their own, which can take corporate IT out of the critical path. When a business
									deploys SharePoint in the cloud, IT can be taken out of the process completely if
									governance mechanisms aren&#8217;t in place. This creates both opportunity and
									challenges. By enabling the business we improve productivity, but by removing
									controls we create risk.</p>
								<p>Organizations that fail to use SharePoint in a strategic way are usually the ones
									that deploy the platform haphazardly and without a governance plan. A lack of
									discipline usually results in disorder regardless of whether the environment is in
									the cloud or on-premises.</p>
								<p>One challenge unique to SharePoint in the cloud is that there are far fewer
									management tools available for multitenant environments. Because there are multiple
									organizations leveraging the environment, hosting companies must limit what any one
									tenant can do so they don&#8217;t impact other tenants in that environment. For
									example, Microsoft doesn&#8217;t currently support Windows PowerShell-based
									administration for SharePoint Online, which means that internal IT staff will have
									challenges administering and monitoring the environment if they&#8217;re used to
									using this method. Also, most third-party management tools designed for on-premises
									environments don&#8217;t work out-of-the-box with SharePoint in Office 365. A few
									companies have created tools specifically for the SharePoint Online environment, but
									they&#8217;re typically less powerful and less common. This will change over time,
									but it&#8217;s important for early adopters to be aware of.</p>
								<p><strong>Does the cloud allow IT to be more strategic when it comes to building
										SharePoint apps? If so, how &#8212; and what&#8217;s the payoff?</strong><br />
									Deploying custom SharePoint applications to the cloud requires more planning because
									of the limitations present in multitenant environments. Building custom Web Parts
									that integrate with internal line-of-business data is a great example. In Office
									365, all custom code must be sandboxed, and line-of-business data must be wrapped
									with a service layer and consumed through Business Connectivity Services. In an
									on-premises environment, you have no restrictions, and you can deploy unrestrained
									custom code solutions and link directly to native data sources. While these
									constraints do add overhead, they also require a more disciplined approach to ensure
									the SharePoint environment doesn&#8217;t collapse due to sloppy code.</p>
								<p>Another strategic advantage to using SharePoint in the cloud is that the vast array
									of add-ins &#8212; such as Access, Excel and Visio Services &#8212; are easily
									enabled and don&#8217;t require administrative support. Many on-premises
									environments we see don&#8217;t have these services enabled because of resource
									constraints or the inability to configure and support them. The cloud also brings
									the ability to cross-organizational and geographic boundaries, which creates
									significant strategic value and opens the door to many additional use cases.</p>
								<p><strong>Can the cloud give IT the kind of control over SharePoint apps that IT might
										be used to?</strong><br />
									In general, the cloud will give IT far less control over SharePoint applications. IT
									will have less visibility into the infrastructure and less control over the
									environment. As we discussed, management interfaces like Windows PowerShell are not
									available, and third-party tool support is limited. There are management APIs and
									enough vendor support to make it work with a little bit of effort. One of the main
									motivations for moving SharePoint to the cloud is to lower administrative costs and
									allow IT to focus on other things. So providing IT less control may be desirable.
								</p>
								<p><strong>What should IT look for in a SharePoint hoster?</strong><br />
									While deploying SharePoint in the cloud is cost effective, migrating an existing
									environment from on-premises or another cloud host isn&#8217;t always easy. The
									amount of migration work is dependent upon the level and nature of customization in
									the source environment and the limitations of the target environment. Because
									switching costs are not trivial, it makes sense to choose your provider carefully.
									The amount of due diligence required should be proportional to the criticality of
									the environment.</p>
								<p><strong>What else should IT consider?</strong><br />
									Organizations would be wise to engage partners who have experience with the target
									SharePoint environment. Because many cloud environments are relatively new, this
									might not be an easy task. Best practices for on-premises SharePoint environments
									are often different from cloud environments. Just because a firm has in-house
									SharePoint experience doesn&#8217;t mean they can move their existing environment to
									the cloud and maintain the same user experience. You can always allocate more
									hardware resources to a performance problem on-premises, but you don&#8217;t have
									that same luxury in a multitenant cloud. The solution must be designed with the
									cloud in mind to perform optimally. Having an experienced vendor involved in the
									migration planning will reduce rework and more than pay for itself over time.</p>
