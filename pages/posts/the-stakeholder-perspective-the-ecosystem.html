								<p>This is the <strong>second article</strong> in a series about a recent paper our team
									submitted to the SEI arguing that technical debt should be defined from what we
									called “The Stakeholder Perspective.”  As we discussed in <a
										href="../the-stakeholder-perspective-introduction.html">the
										introduction</a>, there are many different perspectives from which quality can
									be evaluated.  Ward Cunningham proposed <a
										href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?TechnicalDebt">the most commonly referenced
										definition</a> of technical debt which takes a very developer-oriented view on
									intrinsic factors influencing quality.  While this perspective is indeed valid, it
									tells only part of the story.  The story on quality has major interdependencies and
									managing any piece of it in isolation creates challenges.  Technology environments
									behave similar to biological ecosystems with each layer having dependencies on the
									others.  A big enough gap in any one area can cause the entire system to crumble. 
									Therefore, we believe that managing gaps in quality (i.e. technical debt) should be
									centralized and undertaken as a collaborative effort between key stakeholders.</p>
								<h3><strong>Quality Interdependence</strong></h3>
								<p>In an influential paper evaluating different perspectives on quality, David Garvin
									describes several different lenses through which quality is typically evaluated [2].
									Technical debt’s current definitional framework takes on a perspective similar to
									what Garvin describes as the “manufacturing view.” This view emphasizes impacts to
									quality that are internal to system development. This includes specifications
									compliance, design effectiveness, defect rates and maintenance challenges. If we
									highlight the ISO quality attributes [3] emphasized by technical debt’s current
									definitional framework it might look something like Figure 1. However, this is not a
									perfect representation because the extrinsic elements of the highlighted attributes
									below would not be included.</p>
								<p><a href="../../assets/images/image.png"><img
											loading="lazy" title="image" alt="image"
											src="../../assets/images/image_thumb.png"
											width="609" height="292" border="0" /></a></p>
								<p align="center"><b>Figure 1: ISO 9126 Quality Model [3]</b></p>
								<p>It would be convenient for technology teams to manage quality attributes upon which
									they have the most control. The challenge is that these quality attributes are
									highly interdependent. Areas of the technology infrastructure are interrelated to
									form a structure similar to a biological ecosystem. Each area of the ecosystem has
									inherent dependencies on the others. Decisions made in one area of the
									infrastructure frequently have implications in other areas. Design choices that
									increase Maintainability and Portability, such as deciding to leverage an
									object-relational mapping or interpreted language, often impact Resource
									Utilization. Efforts to improve Security, such as implementing multi-factor
									authentication, usually decrease Usability.</p>
								<p>Technical debt can be a valuable tool when used responsibly to meet organizational
									objectives with limited resources. However, responsible use requires that it be
									accrued strategically with the best possible understanding of its consequences.
									Failure to recognize and account for the interdependencies between quality
									characteristics will lead to the accumulation of technical debt unintentionally.
									Organizations could pay off technical debt in one area and unknowingly accumulate
									debt in another area with a higher interest rate. Unintentional debt is the worst
									possible kind because it cannot be planned for and often does not become visible
									until there is an impact. We will now explore several examples that demonstrate the
									interdependent nature of quality. These examples also happen to fall outside of
									technical debt’s current definitional framework.</p>
								<h4><strong>Deferred functionality</strong></h4>
								<p>When we defer features, we impact the Operability of that system. This can lead to
									undesirable user interactions and ultimately compromise Accuracy by way of data
									integrity. An example of this can come from users “cramming” data in unintended
									places from missing attributes or to fill the gap left by missing functionality. In
									this scenario, Accuracy would be impacted by compromises made to Operability. This
									is depicted in Figure 2 with a pencil icon next to Operability which changed and a
									red arrow next to Accuracy which was unintentionally impacted.</p>
								<p><a href="../../assets/images/Figure-2.png"><img
											loading="lazy" title="Figure-2" alt="Figure-2"
											src="../../assets/images/Figure-2_thumb.png"
											width="524" height="107" border="0" /></a></p>
								<p align="center"><b>Figure 2: Deferred functionality’s effect on overall quality</b>
								</p>
								<p>To illustrate, consider the example of an entity whose ability to be deactivated is
									missing or poorly implemented in the user interface. To differentiate between active
									and inactive records, users sometimes concatenate strings such as “(Inactive)” to
									the name field. Another common example is when there are first and last name fields
									for an entity representing a person, but none for middle name or suffix. Users will
									tend to cram the middle initial in the first name column and the suffix in the last
									name. This behavior has a denormalizing effect on the database and will impact
									downstream processes.</p>
								<h4><b>User experience</b></h4>
								<p>Poor user experience can drive the use of what process experts call hidden factories.
									Missing or poorly implemented features encourage users to create workarounds to
									complete their tasks. These workarounds result in hidden factories that decrease the
									quality and security of the data. The Operability shortcomings in the application
									can unintentionally bring about a decrease in Accuracy and Security as shown in
									Figure 3.</p>
								<p><a href="../../assets/images/Figure-3.png"><img
											loading="lazy" title="Figure-3" alt="Figure-3"
											src="../../assets/images/Figure-3_thumb.png"
											width="544" height="100" border="0" /></a></p>
								<p align="center"><b>Figure 3: User experience’s effect on overall quality</b></p>
								<p>A common example of this is when data is extracted from an application into
									spreadsheets for processing or reporting. These hidden factories appear when
									features are missing from an application or the functionality is more difficult to
									use than the workaround. The logic contained in these spreadsheets is usually not
									sanctioned or controlled, and leads to inconsistency and several “versions of the
									truth.” Additionally, once the data leaves the confines of the system, any controls
									designed to protect it are taken out of play. Hidden factories are unregulated and
									create inefficiencies.</p>
								<h4><strong>Control weaknesses</strong></h4>
								<p>Unintentional debt can also result from missing or inadequate controls. Validation
									control weaknesses decrease data quality by allowing invalid data to be entered into
									the system intentionally (e.g. cramming) or unintentionally (e.g. duplicates, typos,
									etc.). Weakness in access control implementations also presents risk to data quality
									and Security.</p>
								<p><a href="../../assets/images/Figure-4.png"><img
											loading="lazy" title="Figure-4" alt="Figure-4"
											src="../../assets/images/Figure-4_thumb.png"
											width="592" height="104" border="0" /></a></p>
								<p align="center"><b>Figure 4: Control weaknesses’ effect on overall quality</b></p>
								<p>Access controls keep unauthorized users from viewing or editing certain data. Users
									are not permitted access to certain data because they do not have the training or
									clearance to interact with it. Data integrity will suffer when the controls that
									protect that data break down. This is shown in Figure 4 as Accuracy being affected
									by gaps in Security.<b></b></p>
								<h4><strong>Data quality</strong></h4>
								<p>If we think of the technical environment as an ecosystem, data would be analogous to
									the water flowing through a river system. When it is polluted, other downstream
									areas will be impacted. The toxic effects of defective data can ripple across an
									entire infrastructure. Bad data will impose cascading interest on any process or
									system that interacts with it. Inaccurate or incomplete data impairs a system’s
									ability to provide reliable intelligence and integrate with other systems.</p>
								<p><a href="../../assets/images/Figure-5.png"><img
											loading="lazy" title="Figure-5" alt="Figure-5"
											src="../../assets/images/Figure-5_thumb.png"
											width="573" height="105" border="0" /></a></p>
								<p align="center"><b>Figure 5: Data quality’s effect on overall quality</b></p>
								<p>Data quality issues also introduce new technical debt by requiring workarounds in
									data movement logic. These workarounds increase complexity which makes enhancements
									and testing more challenging.</p>
								<h4><strong>Platform suitability</strong></h4>
								<p>For the purpose of this discussion, the “platform” refers to everything that allows
									the software to run. This includes hardware architecture, operating system,
									programming languages and frameworks. The computing platform provides the
									foundational topography upon which the technology ecosystem is built. How well an
									ecosystem is suited to its host topography differentiates success from failure.
									Further, the opportunities and limitations of the topography dictate how the
									ecosystem evolves.</p>
								<p>Likewise, a computing platform that is not well suited to needs of the systems it
									supports will limit capabilities and obstruct evolutionary paths. Every component
									and subcomponent defined in the ISO software quality model is dependent upon the
									underlying platform. Therefore, displaying this relationship visually would not add
									value. Suffice it to say that suitability can impact every other node in Figure 1.

										how it bridges many of the gaps that exist today.</strong></p>
