								<h2>But then you read about SharePoint&#8217;s future.</h2>
								<p>On May 4<sup>th</sup>, Microsoft hosted the “Future of SharePoint” event in San
									Francisco, delivering a long-term vision for the (now) cloud-first, mobile-first
									collaboration tool and energizing the SharePoint community with a restored assurance
									of SharePoint’s vitality.</p>
								<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3084 size-full"
										src="../../assets/images/The_Future_of_SharePoint.png"
										alt="The_Future_of_SharePoint" width="600" height="211"
										srcset="../../assets/images/The_Future_of_SharePoint.png 600w, ../../assets/images/The_Future_of_SharePoint-300x106.png 300w"
										sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
								<p>To understand where we’re headed, it’s important to understand where SharePoint has
									been. SharePoint 2007 attempted to improve upon prior releases (2001 and 2003) with
									simple additions such as Excel services, content types and SharePoint Designer. In
									SharePoint 2010, the ribbon was revealed as well as a premature attempt at social
									and the introduction of Office 365. Sandboxed solutions and client access to the API
									became available, as well as PowerShell support and two-way Business Continuity
									Services (BCS). In SharePoint 2013, Microsoft continued to build on its investment
									in the SharePoint platform and started to include customer feedback into a more
									agile feature development cycle by announcing major improvements. These improvements
									included: drag/down functionality, real-time co-authoring, visual workflows,
									OneDrive for Business, the App Model, improved social capabilities, robust search
									capabilities with the integration of FAST Search, mobile, and the significant
									addition of SharePoint Online, proving even more value for SharePoint.</p>
								<p>Through all of this, there has been underlying uncertainty that Microsoft could
									continue to deliver on the momentum its created. Many often question if SharePoint
									is an inevitable death despite the recent investments Microsoft has committed to
									over the past few years.</p>
								<p>Coming out of the “Future of SharePoint” event, it is clear SharePoint’s future will
									continue to thrive with a customer-centric vision, a dedicated focus on
									modernization and an amicable synergy between Microsoft and Apple aiding in the
									simplicity and convenience for SharePoint users. In fact, this dramatic “reset” to
									SharePoint that will occur over the coming months, will likely shed unfavorable
									perceptions and become the cutting edge technology that customers have craved.
									<strong>Microsoft has reported that “more than 200,000 organizations use SharePoint
										today and an extraordinary community of more than 50,000 partners and 1 million
										developers make up a $10 billion solutions ecosystem around
										SharePoint.”</strong> SharePoint’s future is looks promising once more.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>We are continuing to advance SharePoint, OneDrive and the entire Office 365
										service in ways that make productivity even more collaborative, intelligent,
										mobile and trustworthy.               -Satya Nadella, CEO at Microsoft</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p><strong>Microsoft categorizes the major improvements into four key areas:</strong>
								</p>
								<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3085"

										sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></p>
								<p><strong>Simple and Powerful File Sharing</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>On-demand file access, including team documents</li>

									<li>Introduction of file analytics</li>
									<li>PC/Mac and offline/mobile file syncing</li>
									<li>Intelligent discovery of documents from both OneDrive and SharePoint</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>Security, Privacy, and Compliance</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Simple and powerful set of administrative controls, policies and reports</li>
									<li>Balance between security and usability</li>
									<li>Dynamic Conditional Access Policies; uniquely defines the appropriate access to
										be granted based on user, device and network location</li>
									<li>SharePoint Insights; an aggregation of usage and compliance data from on-prem

									<li>Tools to discover and protect content with Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies
										in both Office 365 and SharePoint Server 2016</li>
									<li>80-pre-built definitions of sensitivity and the ability to customize own
										policies</li>

										combined)</li>
									<li>Bring your own encryption key</li>
									<li>Granular access controls</li>
									<li>SharePoint site classification</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>Mobile and Intelligent Intranet</strong></p>

												including on-prem sites</li>

												<ul>
													<li>Simplified management</li>
													<li>Enterprise-ready</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>Personalized content using Office Graph</li>
											<li>Document List and Library UI upgrades

														received (in line with OneDrive for Business)</li>
													<li>Lists will be easier to use with quick actions for frequently
														used tasks</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>Open and Connected Platform </strong></p>

											<li>Files and Sites API on Microsoft Graph</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>In addition to these coming changes, the ribbon bar is officially being killed. As it
									has created mass confusion since its introduction in 2010, Microsoft is doing away
									with it altogether to better align with the needs and wants of the customer.</p>
								<p>With ILTA’s <a href="http://sharepoint.iltanet.org/home?ssopc=1"
										target="_blank">SharePoint |Office 365 Symposium</a> just around the corner,
									Microsoft’s announcements are timely for the legal community. This will be a chance
									for the legal community to better understand SharePoint’s role in their firm and
									gain trust in this cloud-focused, customer-centric platform that’s renewing its
									luster with each release. I will be presenting on “SharePoint 2016: The Good, the
									Bad, and the Ugly” on Day 1 with BA Insight. Although the presentation is focused on
									the on-prem release, the line is constantly shifting and being blurred between
									online and on-prem.</p>
								<p><strong>If you’re attending SharePoint | Office 365 Symposium in just a couple of
										weeks, stop by the Acrowire booth (#8) and let’s discuss what all of these
										changes mean for your firm.</strong></p>
