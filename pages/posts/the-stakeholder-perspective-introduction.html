								<p>I recently led a team of technology and risk management professionals in developing a
									paper for the <a href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/community/td2011/"
										target="_blank">Second Workshop on Managing Technical Debt</a>.  The call for
									papers is organized by Carnegie Mellon University’s <a
										href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Software Engineering Institute
										(SEI)</a>in preparation for the Workshop which will be held in Hawaii in May.  I
									proposed that we explore the topic at its most fundamental level by evaluating how
									the term is defined and how well suited the concept is to <strong>bridging the gap
										between IT and the business</strong>.  The team accepted the challenge and we
									set out to make our case.  We argued that in order for the concept of technical debt
									to reach its full potential, it must describe shortcomings in the technical
									environment that interfere with organizational objectives <strong>regardless of
										where they reside</strong>.  In order to build on the technical debt concept
									there must be a solid foundation.  We do not feel that such a foundation currently
									exists and we set out to make the case for a more broadly defined notion of the
									concept from what we called “The Stakeholder Perspective.”</p>
								<p>In this series, we will break down the content of our paper into logical sections
									discussing how the current definition focuses primarily on the development team’s
									perspective of quality and why that should change.  The Workshop’s program committee
									features a very distinguished list of thought leaders on the subject of technical
									debt including Ward Cunningham, Israel Gat, Jim Highsmith, Steve McConnell and
									others.  I would like to point out that our team has a tremendous amount of
									appreciation for the contributions these individuals have made to the field of
									software development and project management.  However, we feel that the current
									definition of technical debt under discussion is too fragmented and narrowly
									focused.  To move the concept forward, the interdependent nature of perspectives on
									quality must be recognized.</p>
								<h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
								<p>The technical debt metaphor was coined by Ward Cunningham in 1992 to provide a basis
									for describing the implications associated with shortcuts taken during the software
									development process [1] and the inherent need for refactoring as applications
									evolve. Cunningham’s description of technical debt remains the most commonly
									referenced and is defined as follows.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p><i>“Technical Debt includes those <span
												style="text-decoration: underline;">internal</span> things that you
											choose not to do now, but which will impede future development if left
											undone. This includes deferred refactoring.</i></p>
									<p><i>Technical Debt doesn’t include deferred functionality, except possibly in edge
											cases where delivered functionality is ‘good enough’ for the customer, but
											doesn’t satisfy some standard (e.g., a UI element that isn’t fully compliant
											with some UI standard).”</i></p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>This metaphor allows us to leverage our existing understanding of debt mechanics
									(i.e. principal, interest, compounding, etc.) which provides an excellent tool for
									describing technology gaps in financial terms. The ability to use business-friendly
									terms and concepts facilitates communications between IT departments and other
									stakeholders.</p>
								<p>The software development community conceived the concept and has championed its use
									over the last two decades. This has resulted in a definitional framework heavily
									focused on factors influencing intrinsic quality. Understandably, pioneers of the
									concept used technical debt to describe quality issues within their immediate
									concern and control. However, the lack of focus on quality outside of software
									development may have impaired the concept’s ability to gain traction with
									stakeholders in other areas of discipline.</p>
								<p>The debt metaphor adds <strong>value in describing gaps across the entire technology
										infrastructure</strong> just as well as it does in software development. In
									order to capture that additional value, technical debt should describe issues
									affecting quality more broadly. Stakeholders need a more complete picture of the
									financial impact associated with shortcomings in the technical environment. This
									would enable more effective governance models by providing a centralized way to
									inventory and prioritize initiatives based on objective criteria.</p>
								<p>The purpose of this paper is to propose a definitional framework that will bridge
									several gaps that exist today. First, the definition of technical debt we propose
									will better align to stakeholder concerns. Second, it will account for the fact that
									compromises made in one area of quality often impact others. Lastly, it will promote
									better collaboration between product owners and technology teams when managing
									quality. The goal of this paper is not to provide a complete conceptual model of
									technical debt. Rather, it is to <strong>establish a broad definitional
										framework</strong> upon which a conceptual model could be built.</p>
								<h3><strong>Stakeholder Perspective</strong></h3>
								<p>Technology stakeholders are those individuals or groups who are affected by an
									organization’s technical environment and have a vested interest in its well-being.
									These stakeholders can be internal such as business executives, technology leaders,
									risk managers and end users. They can also include external parties such as
									regulators, shareholders and customers.</p>
								<p>One of technical debt’s most compelling features is its ability to improve
									stakeholder awareness of technology gaps that are costing an organization money.
									Because stakeholders are the intended recipients of communications regarding
									technical debt, the messaging should be relevant to their concerns. Generally,
									stakeholders are concerned if “<strong>the right system was built</strong>” <span
										style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> whether or not “<strong>the
										system was built right</strong>.” Therefore, it matters little whether interest
									is being paid on a code base in need of refactoring or on missing features that are
									impacting efficiency.</p>
								<p>Managing technology gaps consistently across the organization provides many
									stakeholder benefits. Consistency allows business executives to allocate resources
									more effectively by providing a common economic basis to prioritize initiatives.
									This approach also paves the way for centralized governance mechanisms. Centralized
									models provide better transparency around operational challenges thereby improving
									risk management processes. Transparency and effective risk management decreases the
									risk profile of the firm which encourages external investment and lowers the cost of
									capital.</p>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<p><strong>In the next article we will propose an expanded definition of technical debt
										and explore why we feel this perspective adds more value to the
										organization.</strong></p>
