								<p>Given my interest in law factory, I was excited to read recently about a firm that
									actually built one.</p>
								<p>Foreclosure firm goes statistical to improve speed and quality in the ABA Journal
									(March 2014) is an in-depth and fascinating look at how The Hunoval Law Firm built a
									high-volume, efficient foreclosure practice using Lean Six Sigma. I start with
									excerpts from the article, then report on my discussion with Ted Theodoropoulos of
									Acrowire, who helped the firm build its law factory.</p>
								<h3>Here are key excerpts:</h3>
								<p>“In the firm’s first concentrated effort at new efficiencies that began in January
									2013, it achieved an impressive 88 percent decrease in the number of days it takes
									from the time a North Carolina foreclosure referral arrives until it files the
									notice of hearing that begins the process in the courts. An average of 69 days was
									whittled to just eight….</p>
								<p>Hunoval had learned of LSS [Lean Six Sigma] from a personal friend, Ted
									Theodoropoulos, whose company Acrowire helped develop the law firm’s IT system—and
									who also happens to be an LSS black belt who works with law firms on process
									improvement.</p>
								<p>“With such a highly commoditized practice like default service, Lean Six Sigma seemed
									a perfect match—except to a lot of law firms,” says Theodoropoulos, who did process
									management for Bank of America before going out on his own. “Matt wasn’t tied up by
									having done things a certain way for so long that he couldn’t imagine a better way.
									He got it.”…</p>
								<p>Large flat-screen monitors mounted on walls in common areas, such as above photocopy
									machines, display color-coded spreadsheets detailing the past month’s workflow and
									totals in various tasks. At the bottom of the screens, graphics that look like
									streaming stock quotes carry status updates on case files, from intake to
									courthouse, showing where they are in each stage of the process and making it easy
									to spot problems that could slow or even halt their work.</p>
								<p>Outlining the problem of long delays, CIO Kevin Divine of the Hunoval Law Firm asked
									supervisors and staff in the firm’s North Carolina default department how long they
									thought it took from file intake to sending out a notice of hearing to launch the
									foreclosure process. Anecdotally, they saw it as 14 to 20 days. But the crunched
									numbers tallied 69.”</p>
								<p>I spoke to Ted to learn more, both about the process re-engineering and the
									technology Acrowire deployed for Hunoval.</p>
								<p>Ted said that he had started by evaluating the foreclosure process as he found it.
									Ted clocked (literally, with a stop watch) each step in key processes. This helped
									identify areas for improvement. One example was developing a consistent way to
									handle the number of lines in a debtor’s address.</p>
								<p>Digging deeper by talking to staff, Ted discovered “hidden factories”. For example,
									some staff could not get a an envelope feeder to work so they created a manual
									work-around. I love the term “hidden factories” – law firms of all sizes are full of
									them.</p>
								<p>Another hidden factory was built to cut checks. Once the firm marks a loan as
									distressed and appropriate to foreclose, the firm must schedule a hearing. This
									requires cutting a check for the court fee. Staff would fill out a paper
									check-request form as they processed loans and send the completed form to accounts
									payable. This resulted in check requests accumulating – with delays – in the
									accounts payable office.</p>
								<p>The digital request form converted a sequential process into a parallel one: AP could
									now cut checks while staff continued to process loans. This meant that by the time
									papers were ready for court, so too was a check. This saved a couple of days of
									turnaround time. [Note: Ted would have liked to pay courts digitally but that is not
									possible now.]</p>
								<p>The examples illustrate that process improvements can range from the “micro”
									(managing addresses) to the “macro” (changing workflows). In the first
									re-engineering process on which I worked, we changed everything from how lawyers
									reviewed discovery documents to how legal assistants applied bar code labels to
									pieces of paper. You always need micro and macro views.</p>
								<h3>The software behind the process improvements is reasonably straightforward:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Workflow is built on SharePoint</li>
									<li>Performance data is extracted from an existing practice management system into a
										datamart built on SQL Server.</li>
									<li>Metrics are driven from this data by Minitab and displayed to all staff via
										large overhead monitors. A ticker runs along the bottom and the state shown
										rotates every 30 seconds. (I had not heard of Minitab and asked if it is like
										Tableaux, which is cool data visualization software. Ted said yes but that
										Minitab is better aligned with the precepts of Lean Six Sigma.)</li>
								</ul>
								<p>The work here illustrates it is possible to build a law factory to improve law firm
									performance and client service. It also illustrates the close marriage of technology
									deployment and business process improvement. (Acrowire’s range of technology
									services includes support for cloud-services, desktop virtualization, collaboration,
									and custom development, all supported by business process improvement.)</p>
								<p>The law factory results are clear visiting the Process page of the Hunoval website.
									First, most firms don’t have such a page. And second, it highlights a faster process
									powered by Lean Six Sigma, accelerated time to sale, targeted efficiency, and rapid
									scalability. Clearly, this is not the usual law firm.</p>
								<p>Some may dismiss the applicability of the story here to large law firms, thinking
									that in Big Law, there is not enough routine work to warrant this type of effort.
									Perhaps. But enough large law firms have done similar projects to suggest we have
									only just begun the journey to uncover hidden factories and fix them.</p>
