						<p>If you&#8217;re in the market for migrating data from one platform to another, you&#8217;re likely finding that there is a host of tools available ranging at various price points. Depending on the features available, SharePoint migration platforms can be as little as $1,999 and into the tens of thousands. In this blog post, we&#8217;ll highlight one of these tools, <a href="http://en.share-gate.com/sharepoint-migration" target="_blank">ShareGate Migration</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note: Opinions and experiences stated in this blog post are our own. We have not been incentivized in any way to review this product. </em></p>
<p>ShareGate Migration is priced on the lower end at $1,999 for a single user license and is for migrating data only. The ShareGate product line does include an option for a SharePoint Management Tool, but we will not be covering that at this time. Here, we&#8217;ll dive into the more common and interesting features available with ShareGate to help summarize this product for you.</p>
<p>When you launch ShareGate Migration you will see a screen similar to that shown below. You can do quite a bit, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy Site Objects like Site Collections and sub-sites</li>
<li>Copy content like Documents, list items and document sets</li>
<li>Import data from file shares into SharePoint</li>
<li>Export from SharePoint into file shares</li>
<li>Script out your actions using PowerShell</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../assets/images/1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2284" src="../../assets/images/1.png" alt="1" width="500" height="543" srcset="../../assets/images/1.png 634w, ../../assets/images/1-276x300.png 276w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>One of the options you have is to set the level of performance when migrating your content. This can be helpful to control how much impact the migration will have on your end users that are still working in SharePoint while you are migrating content. Using the slider, you can choose how much or how little of your servers resources should be used for the migration tool. The more you use, the faster ShareGate runs, but your users may see a performance hit while using SharePoint.</p>
<p><a href="../../assets/images/2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2285" src="../../assets/images/2.png" alt="2" width="400" height="238" srcset="../../assets/images/2.png 510w, ../../assets/images/2-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>Here is a quick look at some of the options you have when migrating a site collection from on-prem to SharePoint Online.</p>
<p>Some options you can set for your migrations are highlighted in the ribbon. You can set options for things like what site templates you want to assign, and what to do with unresolved users.</p>
<p><a href="../../assets/images/3.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2286" src="../../assets/images/3-1024x328.png" alt="3" width="500" height="160" srcset="../../assets/images/3-1024x328.png 1024w, ../../assets/images/3-300x96.png 300w, ../../assets/images/3.png 1130w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Here is a look at the screen for mapping site templates. This is useful if you want to choose specific templates to be migrated. For example, there is no site template for a “Blank Site” in SharePoint Online, so you can choose to have any source site that is a “Blank Site Template” to be migrated to a “Team Site” template or whatever you wish.</p>
<p><a href="../../assets/images/4.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2287" src="../../assets/images/4.png" alt="4" width="500" height="268" srcset="../../assets/images/4.png 803w, ../../assets/images/4-300x161.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>The tool tries to maintain the information for the Created By and Modified By fields, but sometimes the users no longer exist in the company. Therefore, you have the option of setting those “unresolved users” to a default user of your choice.</p>
<p><a href="../../assets/images/5.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2288" src="../../assets/images/5.png" alt="5" width="500" height="195" srcset="../../assets/images/5.png 976w, ../../assets/images/5-300x117.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Once you have chosen your source and destination, you are presented with a series of screens for setting certain additional options. The Title of your destination site is set to the same as the source, but you can change it, as needed. The URL gives you the choice of the two online options, Sites or Teams, and then what you want the URL to be, again defaulting to the source’s value. Because the destination is SharePoint Online, you can set the values for the storage quota and the Resource Quota.</p>
<p>The other options are self-explanatory and give you a decent amount of control over what you do or do not want to migrate over, including sub sites.</p>
<p><a href="../../assets/images/6.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2289" src="../../assets/images/6.png" alt="6" width="450" height="372" srcset="../../assets/images/6.png 603w, ../../assets/images/6-300x248.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>The next screen gives you the option to choose to monitor the migration and decide on a case by case basis what to do when certain conditions are encountered (Interactive Mode), or to set default actions and let the job run without you monitoring it (Silent Mode):</p>
<p><a href="../../assets/images/7.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2290" src="../../assets/images/7.png" alt="7" width="400" height="197" srcset="../../assets/images/7.png 557w, ../../assets/images/7-300x148.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>If you choose ‘Silent Mode’ you can then set the default actions for certain conditions, again giving you some flexibility in how and what gets migrated.</p>
<p><a href="../../assets/images/8.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2291" src="../../assets/images/8.png" alt="8" width="700" height="149" srcset="../../assets/images/8.png 812w, ../../assets/images/8-300x64.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a> <a href="../../assets/images/9.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2292" src="../../assets/images/9.png" alt="9" width="700" height="167" srcset="../../assets/images/9.png 812w, ../../assets/images/9-300x72.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a> <a href="../../assets/images/10.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2293" src="../../assets/images/10.png" alt="10" width="706" height="241" srcset="../../assets/images/10.png 806w, ../../assets/images/10-300x102.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 100vw, 706px" /></a></p>
<p>One of the other nice features is the ability to perform a ‘Pre-Migration Check.’ This lets you set many of the options we showed above and generate a migration report without actually migrating the content. This can be very useful as a way of seeing what issues you will encounter and gives you a chance to address them before actually migrating. The migration report can be exported to an Excel file and reviewed by the team any time.</p>
<p><a href="../../assets/images/11.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2294" src="../../assets/images/11.png" alt="11" width="255" height="98" /></a></p>
<p>When a ‘Pre-Migration Check’ or actual migration is complete, a migration report is created. This tells you any of the warnings and errors that were encountered.<br />
These reports are in an Excel format that you can export and store/share. Below are a couple of screen shots showing some of the fields it exports including the warning/error message:</p>
<p><a href="../../assets/images/12.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2295" src="../../assets/images/12-1024x251.png" alt="12" width="540" height="133" srcset="../../assets/images/12-1024x251.png 1024w, ../../assets/images/12-300x74.png 300w, ../../assets/images/12.png 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="../../assets/images/13.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2296" src="../../assets/images/13-1024x356.png" alt="13" width="540" height="187" srcset="../../assets/images/13-1024x356.png 1024w, ../../assets/images/13-300x104.png 300w, ../../assets/images/13.png 1204w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>A helpful feature of the Migration Report is a column, Help Links:</p>
<p><a href="../../assets/images/14.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2297" src="../../assets/images/14.png" alt="14" width="217" height="112" /></a></p>
<p>If ShareGate has a helpful article about how to address the error that was thrown, this column will have a link to it so you can click the link and see what their recommendations are for how to address it. An example of this is shown below:</p>
<p><a href="../../assets/images/15.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2298" src="../../assets/images/15.png" alt="15" width="519" height="515" srcset="../../assets/images/15.png 719w, ../../assets/images/15-150x150.png 150w, ../../assets/images/15-300x298.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px" /></a></p>
<p><em>Tip:</em> One thing that can be frustrating using the tool is when you choose to save the Migration report. The default name it gives for the report is very generic. There is no mention of the actual site title that was migrated, so you need to keep track of what you are doing so you can properly name your reports.</p>
<p>Overall, I have been pleased with the tool, especially for the price. It also bears mentioning that the responsiveness of the support team has been very good. I usually get a reply in the same day and they follow up with me until it is resolved.</p>
<p>There are several tools out there to help with your migration and I do feel that ShareGate is well worth looking at. If you have questions or additional information to share, I&#8217;d love to hear from you.</p>
