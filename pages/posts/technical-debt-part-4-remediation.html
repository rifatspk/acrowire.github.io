							<div class="entry-content">
								<p>In the first three parts of this series we discussed topics related to <a
										href="../technical-debt-part-1-definition.html">defining</a>,<a
										href="../technical-debt-part-2-identification.html"> identifying</a>,
									and <a
										href="../technical-debt-part-3-quantifying.html">quantifying</a> technical
									debt.  In this article we will discuss topics for consideration when planning a
									remediation initiative.  The first thing to recognize before planning a payback
									strategy is that it is an ongoing effort.  Paying back technical debt can be similar
									to a game of whack-a-mole.  As you pay down debt in one area, new debt appears in
									another.  This is a natural and unavoidable phenomena.</p>
								<p><strong>Change Creates Debt</strong></p>
								<p>Even if your company were to never write another line of code, you would continue to
									accumulate new technical debt.  This is a result of change outside the technical
									environment.  Technical debt accrues when the environment a system supports changes
									or our understanding of that environment evolves.  The operating environment can be
									thought of as the collection of people, processes, technologies and external events
									that impact the application in some way.</p>
								<p>Operating environments are in near-constant motion by their nature, and the
									applications that support those environments must be modified to accommodate that
									motion.  Even if the environment internal to the organization remains constant, the
									external environment will change.  Examples of external changes that impact an
									application could include the introduction of new technologies into the market,
									improvements in engineering practices, emerging threats, etc.  This movement
									requires technical teams to incrementally adjust the application and refine those
									adjustments as they better understand the environment.  Technical debt will accrue
									between the time the change takes place and when the application is modified to
									accommodate it.</p>
								<p><strong>Misalignment</strong></p>
								<p>When an application is first built, the teams who are building it have a limited
									understanding of exactly what it should look like.  Development teams create an
									initial mental model of the application based on their limited understanding.  <a
										href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Discipline">Peter Senge defined
										mental models</a> as “assumptions, generalizations, or even pictures of images
									that influence how we understand the world and how we take action.”  The limited
									understanding of the environment leads to a fairly inaccurate initial mental model.
								</p>
								<p>Therefore even if there are no shortcuts taken during the development process, there
									is a gap between the functionality the application provides and what’s really needed
									to fully support the environment. The Venn diagram in Figure 1 illustrates the
									typical relationship between the first release of an application, the team’s initial
									mental model of the environment, and the environment itself.  As you would expect,
									the application is closely aligned with the mental model.  However, neither is well
									aligned with the actual environment.  Everything within the environment circle that
									is not intersected by the application represents technical debt.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p><a href="../../assets/images/Figure-11.png"><img
												loading="lazy" title="Figure-1" alt="Figure-1"
												src="../../assets/images/Figure-1_thumb1.png"
												width="508" height="239" border="0" /></a></p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>As time passes, the development team gains a better understanding of the environment
									and the mental model improves.  If the application is updated to reflect this
									improved understanding, alignment also improves and technical debt is reduced as in
									Figure 2.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p><a href="../../assets/images/Figure-21.png"><img
												loading="lazy" title="Figure-2" alt="Figure-2"
												src="../../assets/images/Figure-2_thumb1.png"
												width="529" height="238" border="0" /></a></p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>This alignment is a temporary state.  Once additional change occurs in the
									environment, things begin to look like Figure 1 again.</p>
								<p><strong>Prioritization</strong></p>
								<p>The value of the debt metaphor is its ability to frame technology gaps into a
									paradigm that any business person can understand.  It can be challenging to get
									business partners to see the value of allocating resources to address something they
									may not see or fully appreciate.  Putting technical shortcomings in terms of dollars
									and cents allows organizations to calculate the ROI on principal repayment.  As a
									result, better decisions on where to invest technology dollars are made.  Without
									the ability to demonstrate an ROI, convincing business partners to put off new
									features to payback technical debt becomes very difficult.</p>
								<p>Let’s quickly calculate the return on the investment necessary to pay back the
									technical debt associated with the legacy application we discussed in <a
										href="../technical-debt-part-3-quantifying.html">Part 3</a>.  The
									principal amount owed on the debt is currently $160,000.  If we were to pay the
									principal back today, we would avoid approximately $215,000 in inflation adjusted
									interest expense over the next five years.  That gives the project to update the
									legacy application an ROI of 35%.  Now we can compare that ROI to other initiatives
									and prioritize our inventory accordingly.</p>
								<p><strong>Repayment Options</strong></p>
								<p>The implications to paying off technical debt should be considered carefully.  It is
									good practice to evaluate how end users of the technology will be impacted and
									choose a strategy to minimize disruptions.  Some scenarios will be completely
									transparent such as refactoring poorly implemented code.  In the example of our
									legacy application, however, there is a high probability of end user impact. 
									Migrating platforms usually involves introducing a new user interface and changes to
									how functionality is implemented.</p>
								<p>Even if end user impact is unavoidable there are usually strategies available to
									mitigate the effect.  Taking an incremental approach can make the transition easier
									on the technology teams and end users.  For example, if our legacy application uses
									a three tier architecture we might consider migrating the database and middle tier
									to the target platform and migrate the user interface last.  This would afford us
									the opportunity to test two of the three tiers in a production capacity with
									potentially little impact to the end users.  Additionally, if the user interface is
									fairly modular we may be able to migrate it incrementally as well.</p>
								<p><strong>In the next and final post in this series we will discuss ideas on how to
										govern technical debt effectively.</strong></p>
