								<p>It’s our favorite time of the year again. <a
										href="http://www.iltacon.org/home?_ga=1.39303969.307812363.1427593706&amp;ssopc=1"
										target="_blank">ILTACON2016</a> is here, which means reconnecting with old
									friends, as well as making many more at this year’s conference. For those of you
									unfamiliar with ILTACON, the International Legal Technology Association’s (<a
										href="http://www.iltacon.org/home?ssopc=1" target="_blank">ILTA</a>) annual
									conference, this epic event is a four-day educational conference that gives the
									legal community the opportunity to learn from personal and collective strengths of
									fellow techies within the industry. ILTACON provides new insights about what works,
									what doesn’t work, as well as the tools necessary to keep up with the ever-changing
									world of technology. Speaking of ever-changing technology, ILTA’s theme, “Embracing
									Change” seems fitting, especially as we celebrate 25 years of the world wide web
									this month!</p>
								<p>This year, keynote speakers include <a href="http://mike-walsh.com/"
										target="_blank">Mike Walsh</a> and <a href="http://danielmartinkatz.com/"
										target="_blank">Dan Katz</a>. Walsh, who is an author and global speaker, will
									offer original insights to empower business owners to understand and unleash their
									future potential, in his session titled, “Re-Imagining Legal Technology for the 21st
									Century.” Dan Katz will help us identify and solve legal issues in, “Measure Twice,
									Cut Once: Solving the Legal Profession&#8217;s Biggest Problems Together.” But wait…
									ILTACON isn’t all business. There are dozens of activities planned from golf to
									yoga; however, a good steak with a few of my closest friends and peers usually wins
									every time.</p>

								<p>I was encouraged by the “Embracing Change” theme this year as legal has come a long
									way with accepting and adopting new technologies. With these changes have come
									success and efficiencies that have rewritten industry standards and practices. Each
									year ILTA offers a wide variety of sessions which cater to different roles within a
									business, in an effort to help us stay on top of new practices that are prevalent
									within the legal industry. In fact, choosing which sessions to attend may very well
									be your biggest obstacle at the convention. Sessions that caught my eye capturing
									the essence of ILTACON this year include: <a

								<p>So, what’s relevant about all of this?</p>
								<p>Embracing change is not just a message that resonates to the legal industry. All
									industries are adjusting to innovation and technological change. We as consumers,
									business owners, employees, and suppliers are becoming smarter, more informed and
									better connected. Together, we are all embracing change and learning how to succeed
									in this new era. And in no time at all, today’s change will be as if it always
									existed just as the world wide web has so easily become a part of our everyday
									lives.</p>
								<p>So, let’s talk about that. In just 25 years we’ve embraced the world wide web as if
									it’s always existed. However, in the midst of such rapid innovation and upgrades,
									gadgets and trends can come and go in the blink of an eye. Remember the Apple Newton
									PDA? How about the IBM PCjr? Yeah, I didn’t think so. But while some technologies
									flop, some emerging tech trends make you wonder, “Why didn’t I think of that?”</p>
								<p>Here are a few, more recent trends in technology that are rewriting the future:<br />
									o Self-driving cars<br />
									o Amazon bots<br />
									o Cloud computing<br />
									o Delivery drones<br />
									o Alexa/Siri<br />
									o Skype (ever Skype on an airplane?)</p>
								<p>With technology advancing so rapidly, it is hard to imagine what is to come in the
									future. <a
										href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/gede45ghi/1-the-device-mesh/#205dd2fb2777"
										target="_blank">Gartner’s top tech trends for 2016</a> gives us a sneak peek
									into up and coming technologies like 3D Printing, Advanced Machine Learning, and
									Adaptive Security Architecture. Just as technologies that have emerged in the past,
									these will enable new efficiencies and productivities. Those who are able to embrace
									these changes will separate themselves from the rest of the pack.</p>
								<p>So what does all this change mean for your organization? Well, let’s look at Amazon,
									who earned the #1 spot on the list of the <a
										href="https://www.technologyreview.com/lists/companies/2016/intro/#baidu"
										target="_blank">Top 50 Smartest Companies</a> by MIT Technology Review. Amazon
									has done as well as the next guy at staying ahead of the technology curve. Not only
									did they recently introduce voice service, Alexa (the personal assistant we never
									knew we always needed), but they also have incorporated robots into their
									fulfillment centers, which has streamlined processes, cutting operating costs by
									about 20%. Amazon didn&#8217;t yield this success with the &#8220;wait and
									see&#8221; approach; they embraced change and allowed it to work for them versus
									against them. In order to follow in their footsteps, ‘smart’ companies will adopt
									and embrace these changes. The days of waiting to see what everyone else is using
									are over. Risk management comes with the territory; therefore, it should be managed
									accordingly in order to compete and succeed.</p>
								<p>While we eagerly await ILTACON 2017 with eyes to the future, we at Acrowire, will be
									embracing new changes in technology as we quicken our pace to stay ahead of the
									curve. In this age of innovation, idle time must be a thing of the past and should
									be avoided at all costs in order to prosper in the swiftly moving rip tides of our
									society.</p>
								<p><em>What barriers are hindering your ability to embrace change?</em> Is it funding?
									Regulations? Corporate culture?</p>
								<p>I hope that you too will embrace the new changes, the efficiencies and insights that
									come with them. Welcome to the lightning round! Until next year, ILTACON!</p>
