								<p>Microsoft’s latest release of SharePoint represents a major milestone for the product
									in terms of new capabilities and adoption of industry standards. While Microsoft has
									been touting their commitment to industry standards for some time now, SharePoint
									2013 now delivers on that promise with the new “app model.”</p>
								<p><strong>What’s the difference between the old “solution model” and the new “app
										model”?</strong> How can law firms, legal departments and their enterprise
									content management systems and processes benefit from the app model? Firms are
									finding out building alongside SharePoint is a better approach than building on
									SharePoint.</p>
								<h3>SHAREPOINT AS A DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM</h3>
								<p>Many organizations that need to build custom Web applications will default to a .NET
									or open source architecture. While this approach makes sense in many cases, using
									SharePoint as a framework brings building blocks that can be leveraged to piece
									together a Web application very quickly. These out-of-the-box features address needs
									many law firms have, including:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Content management and intranets</li>
									<li>Extranets and client portals</li>
									<li>Basic document management</li>
									<li>Workflow and process control</li>
									<li>Enterprise search</li>
									<li>Integrated authentication</li>
									<li>Calendaring and collaboration</li>
								</ul>
								<p>In the past, the downsides of customizing SharePoint were significant and often
									locked organizations into the version of the product they customized. It is common
									to see law firms running SharePoint environments two and three versions back because
									they know an upgrade will likely break the customizations the firm now depends on.
									With SharePoint 2013, however, developers can leverage all out-of-the-box
									capabilities and deploy custom features without the risk. As with any new
									technology, there is a learning curve, but the benefits will outweigh the drawbacks
									often.</p>
								<h3>THE OLD WAY: THE SOLUTIONS MODEL</h3>
								<p>To understand why the new app model is so important, we must understand the solution
									model and how custom functionality has been built in previous versions. The most
									popular way to deploy custom code in SharePoint 2007 and 2010 is by leveraging
									full-trust solutions (called “full trust” because, once deployed, they have broad
									access to the internal workings of SharePoint). This makes them extremely powerful
									and easy to build. Even in SharePoint 2013, fully trusted solutions usually are the
									quickest way to deploy custom functionality to on-premise environments. (A
									full-trust solution cannot be used with SharePoint Online.) The full-trust approach
									has been in place for a long time, which means it is well-documented and understood.
									The approach also gives developers access to the most complete application
									programming interface (API).</p>
								<p>As great as this solution model approach sounds, it has a major flaw. The custom code
									runs directly on the SharePoint server. This presents challenges to administrators
									who need to keep the environment up and running efficiently. Fully trusted solutions
									extend the capabilities of the product on the SharePoint server, so when custom code
									misbehaves it can bring down the entire environment. The deployment of custom code
									can crash SharePoint, affecting hundreds or thousands of users. It is a classic case
									of custom code having too much access with administrators having too little control.
									Even with quality assurance (QA) processes in place, it is difficult to mitigate the
									risk fully because of how trusted solutions can respond to different environmental
									factors. Although full-trust solutions are sometimes quicker to deploy and appear
									cheaper to develop in the short run, they often lead to a higher overall total cost
									of ownership (TCO). The savings derived from customizing SharePoint in this way are
									less like true savings and more like technical debt. This debt drives up TCO through
									long-term interest costs in the form of:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Environments that are less stable</li>
									<li>Capacity planning made more difficult</li>
									<li>QA processes that need to be more rigorous</li>
									<li>A product forced to remain in the legacy version</li>
									<li>Deployment models that are clumsy</li>
									<li>Additional environmental complexities</li>
									<li>Developers with specialized knowledge that cost more</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Microsoft attempted to address some of the shortcomings of the full-trust solution
									model with what they called “sandboxed Web parts.” However, that was a failed
									experiment; the approach has since been deprecated.</p>
								<h3>THE NEW WAY: THE APP MODEL</h3>
								<p>There is a widely accepted design principle in software engineering called
									“separation of concerns” (SoC). SoC promotes the use of a loosely coupled
									architecture that encapsulates code into modular units that address individual
									tasks. Separating concerns reduces complexity and makes swapping out pieces of the
									system less challenging by reducing dependencies.</p>
								<p>The SharePoint 2013 app model fully embraces this mantra by mandating that no custom
									code ever run on the SharePoint server directly. Custom application code must run
									either in the Web browser (i.e., HTML/CSS/JavaScript) or on a separate server
									altogether. Instead of building directly on SharePoint, you are building alongside
									it, which differs from the fully trusted solution approach.</p>
								<p>In addition to the changes in architecture, the app model also changes the underlying
									technologies used to deliver custom functionality. The fully trusted approach uses
									server-side solutions typically written in C#, leveraging the server-side object
									model (SSOM). Apps are not deployed on the SharePoint server, so they can be written
									in many server-side technologies. While this opens many doors, the app model
									approach necessitates the need to interact with SharePoint using the client-side
									object model (CSOM) via a REST-based API usually accessed through JavaScript. Some
									SharePoint apps can use client-side code that runs in the browser exclusively,
									eliminating the need for any server-side infrastructure.</p>
								<h3>MORE BENEFITS OF THE APP MODEL</h3>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>Hire Fewer Staff with Specialized Skill Sets:</strong> According to an
										annual study by Dice.com, the national unemployment rate for software developers
										is under two percent as of late 2013. The rate is expected to stay at or below
										this level in 2014. When the labor market is this tight, it puts upward pressure
										on payroll costs and makes attracting and retaining talent challenging. This is
										especially true in the legal industry. While there are innovative and
										technology- driven law firms out there, the industry is not perceived as
										progressive or cutting-edge. Law firms usually are not the first place talented
										technical professionals have on the radar. Regardless of how you feel about that
										perception, it can make competing for and retaining top technical talent even
										more challenging for law firms.Using apps to deliver custom functionality now
										requires less SharePoint-specific knowledge because developers use industry-
										standard technologies to build apps, such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, REST, JSON,
										OData and OAuth. Developers must still have a working knowledge of SharePoint
										objects and how to interact with them using the CSOM, but several development
										and deployment nuances of full-trust solutions have been reduced or eliminated
										with apps. This lowers entry barriers for developers by reducing the amount of
										specialized SharePoint domain knowledge required. More developers know how to
										build apps using open standards over the old SharePoint solution model. The app
										model reduces the required amount of SharePoint-specific expertise, expanding
										the pool of candidates in an already tight talent pool.</li>
									<li><strong>Upgrade and Secure with Fewer Issues:</strong> Full-trust solutions are
										entwined with SharePoint’s underlying infrastructure, so upgrading a customized
										environment can be extremely high-risk. Even applying patches and service packs
										could break customizations. Keeping SharePoint up to date is about more than
										just enabling new capabilities; it is also about maintaining a secure
										environment that is supported by Microsoft. Security vulnerabilities are
										identified all the time in the IT world, and keeping products updated is the
										number one countermeasure against attacks. Having a fragile SharePoint
										environment that cannot be updated due to tightly coupled customizations creates
										a difficult dilemma.It is incumbent upon technology leaders to maintain a
										reliable and secure IT environment that provides the capabilities the business
										needs to stay competitive. Deploying tightly coupled SharePoint solutions makes
										it difficult to achieve that mission by making firms reluctant to deploy the
										next version or service pack. Customizing SharePoint using the app model
										drastically reduces the need to shy away from updates by keeping customizations
										loosely coupled. Apps use a service-oriented architecture that reduces
										dependencies and does not lock firms into the version of SharePoint currently
										being used. This will ensure vulnerabilities are mitigated, the latest
										capabilities are enabled and the environment is supported should a call to
										Microsoft become necessary.</li>
									<li><strong>Launch SharePoint Online:</strong> Many law firms have not embraced
										cloud computing for various reasons. Some firms have clients that do not allow
										it or that have regulatory requirements that make multi- tenant platforms like
										SharePoint Online (a part of Microsoft’s Office 365) a non-starter. Other firms
										are not comfortable with their data residing outside their network, or they
										stayed away from SharePoint Online because deploying custom functionality there
										had significant limitations. The app model does not always address regulatory
										issues or a lack of comfort with the cloud, but it does remove many limitations
										developers faced customizing the platform.For firms not prohibited from using
										the cloud, SharePoint Online is now a viable alternative. SharePoint is a great
										product, but it can get very expensive when you factor in the licensing,
										hardware and manpower required to keep a firm running at peak performance.
										SharePoint Online uses a cost-effective subscription model and eliminates the
										need for firms to manage the environment and keep it secure and up to date.
										There are still limitations to SharePoint Online, but the app model has at least
										made it worthy of consideration.</li>
									<li><strong>Reduce Risk and Improve Performance:</strong> Code never runs on the
										SharePoint server using the app model, and it is difficult for the platform to
										be severely affected by the resource utilization of apps. Apps are built
										alongside SharePoint, so you can load test them independently. The
										signal-to-noise ratio goes down dramatically when you can test custom code
										independently from the SharePoint server. All of this translates into a better
										user experience and higher service levels, both of which are two of the most
										important metrics for any IT environment.</li>
								</ol>
								<h3>MODELING A MOVE TOWARD REAL CHANGE</h3>
								<p>Leveraging the app model can be a real game changer for your firm and its enterprise
									content management strategies. As Microsoft continues to make SharePoint more
									appealing to the next generation of application developers, resisting adoption will
									not be a sustainable strategy. With the advent of the SharePoint app model, there
									are ample opportunities for growth for current SharePoint developers and the
									potential for real change in how your law firm leverages the platform.</p>
