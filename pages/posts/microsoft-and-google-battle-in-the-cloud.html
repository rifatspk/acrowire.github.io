								<p>The battle for cloud based email and productivity between Microsoft and Google has
									really heated up recently. In October, Microsoft announced the next iteration of its
									Business Productivity Online Suite (BPOS) which is being rebranded as Office 365.
									This will be a significant release as the online service will be based on
									Microsoft’s latest versions of Exchange, SharePoint and Lync (formally
									Communicator). The fact that Microsoft has not offered the 2010 version of these
									tools in its online suite has been frustrating to resellers and subscribers alike.
								</p>
								<p>In addition to the new name and latest versions of the underlying platforms,
									Microsoft has also modified the price structure. For businesses with fewer than 25
									employees, Microsoft will charge $6 per user per month; for larger companies, plans
									start at $2 per user per month for email alone. Prices scale up to $27 per user a
									month, which includes telephony features (voicemail in your inbox) and video/voice
									conferencing. There’s also a single sign-on to access all of these services. Before
									now, Microsoft sold its Business Productivity Online Suite for $120/user/year.
									Google Apps runs $50 per user per year, so Microsoft’s new price points are much
									more competitive.</p>
								<p>Further evidence that the two companies are focusing efforts against one another is
									several recent announcements that <a
										href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/capgemini-now-championing-microsoft-bpos-over-google-apps/6272">heavy
										hitters are transitioning their focus to promoting BPOS/Office365</a> and <a
										href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9195160/Microsoft_We_8217_re_more_enterprise_ready_than_Google_Apps">Microsoft
										claiming their service is more “enterprise ready.”</a> Both Capgemini and Serena
									Software had practices dedicated to Google Apps Premier Edition (GAPE)
									implementations and it appears both companies are now focusing on BPOS/Office365.
									This is significant because IT partners typically have substantial influence with
									the clients they serve. Many businesses rely on trusted relationships with their
									technology partners for guidance and feedback on platform decisions. Additional
									defections could damage Google’s ability to generate credibility in the enterprise
									space. Google came out of the gate with GAPE much earlier than Microsoft did with
									BPOS but Microsoft dominates the enterprise email market with their Exchange
									product.</p>
								<p>We at Acrowire were early adopters of GAPE but migrated to BPOS this year because of
									our strong Microsoft partnership and GAPE’s poor Outlook integration. Google hurt
									themselves considerably this year by failing to provide GAPE support for Office 2010
									at RTM. It wasn’t <a
										href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/google-calendar-sync-now-supports.html">until
										late August</a> that GAPE provided the ability to synchronize your Google
									Calender with Outlook 2010. That was almost one full year after the Office 2010 beta
									began.</p>
								<p>It seems as if Google’s rivalry with Microsoft got the better of them and they failed
									to recognize how significant Outlook is in the everyday lives of business users.
									Salesforce.com is guilty of the same indiscretion but has finally provided basic
									integration capabilities. Microsoft competitors should recognize that not making
									their products and services compatible with the tools that businesses rely on only
									hurts their cause and helps their competitors. It seems like a pretty basic concept
									but one that continues to elude Microsoft’s biggest rivals. Rather <a
										href="http://www.tomsguide.com/us/Department-of-Interior-lawsuit-Google-apps-BPOS-Federal-request-for-quotation,news-8565.html">than
										spending money on attorneys and litigation</a>, it seems like those resources
									would be better served allocated towards developing features that benefit their
									subscribers.</p>
								<p>Microsoft suffers from this same lack of awareness and their customers pay the price
									as well. This is especially true in the browser space. Many of Microsoft’s products
									continue to leverage proprietary technology and limit functionality when not used
									with Internet Explorer. SharePoint is a prime example where the user experience is
									negatively impacted when used with browsers other than IE. Unfortunately it appears
									that this trend could continue with Office365. Google’s Chrome browser is
									noticeably <a
										href="http://office365.microsoft.com/en-US/office-web-apps.aspx">absent from the
										list of compatible browsers on the Office365 feature page</a>. If history is any
									sort of indicator this was not an unintentional omission and was likely a strategic
									decision by Microsoft. As unlikely as it is, one can’t help but hope for a day when
									vendors put their own agendas second to that of their customers.</p>
