                                    begin using Groups with your team today. You will understand the different types of
                                    Groups, how to manage Groups, how permissions are impacted, and how Groups are
                                    different from Yammer, etc.</p>

                                    or query. The source of the problem could be any number of things, not the least of
                                    which is poorly configured hardware or software &#8212; including SQL Server.
                                    Throwing big iron hardware at it will not always solve the problem, may mask what is
                                    going on and is an expensive way to deal with performance issues. Avoiding the top

                                    standpoint, but comes saddled with high costs, a demand for resources and limited
                                    scalability. SharePoint Online, on the other hand, alleviates the burden associated
                                    with SharePoint on-premise by removing the need for servers, software licenses and
                                    personnel, and can be rolled out to a large pool of people virtually overnight.
                                    However, you&#8217;ll still need support for integration projects. We discuss the
